parse_tags_transformed - Parse a custom expando of the form, "%G?" where '?' is an alphabetic character.
  	test '?' is [A-Za-z]?

quick guides to
	format strings
	tagging
	alias labels
		document and asciinema alias tags:

doc tags in alias, mail to user ml
	add to dyk

lua / lua-source aren't documented ANYWHERE
	need feature page with examples

good first issue?
	add tag-pattern to the browser -- useful for compose-attach
		if multi-selection is allowed

attach refactor
	libattach
	dlg(view)attach
	pass attach list to functions
		(c.f. tagged emails)

"Out of memory" translation still used?!

note alx: ptr vs pptr

apply colour to a column
	find the index_format node when the `color` command is used
	or when $index_format is set
what about row colours?

extend
	`color header green default '^Subject'`
	to allow partial matches, like status color does
	e.g.
		color header green default '^Subject: (.*)' 1
	match the text of the subject only

$attach_status to configure the AttachBar
	default to "Attachments" ?
	or "Attachments: %n"
	what else could we display?
	cumulative size?
	allow *email* expandos, e.g. To: %t, Subject: %s!

Is this ever true?
	_fmt(OP_SEARCH, N_("search for a regular expression")) \
	or are we always searching for a *pattern*?

for the Menu,
	where is the "deleted" colour?
	where is the dedicated "tagged" colour?
	color index fg bg "~T" !
	create colour "links" first

docs: improve transform-links.vim
	update deprecated.patch
	put in repo with README

coverage core (simple)
	command
	config_cache
	neomutt
	much of mailbox

Menu: rename line to row?
	int (*make_entry)(struct Menu *menu, int line, int max_cols, struct Buffer *buf);
	need to fix Menu.search() too

roccoblues
	when you look in buffer.h you'll notice that most of the time str in the name
	signifies a char * but not always. buf_addstr vs. buf_insert. Or buf_startswith
	should be buf_startswith_str because we could also have a buf_startwith(Buffer, Buffer)?

bare mode cf weechat
	wrapping, markers '+', scrollbar
	all interfere with copy'n'paste and urls
	<bare-mode> drop into basic pager -- endwin()
		bind to Ctrl-B
	don't wrap, just dump email to screen
	let terminal do page up / down
	optionally use ansi sequences for urls?
		probably not necessary
	'q' <quit> to exit
	eliminates need for urlview / urlscan
	why not use <pipe-message>cat<enter> ?

unify Address Groups and Alias Tags
	then group patterns match tags
	%c GROUP   messages carbon-copied to any member of GROUP
	%C GROUP   messages either to:, cc: or bcc: to any member of GROUP
	%e GROUP   messages which contain a member of GROUP in the 'Sender' field
	%f GROUP   messages originating from any member of GROUP
	%L GROUP   message either originated or received by any member of GROUP
group commands
	alias        [ -group name ...] key address [ , address ...]
	unalias      [ -group name ...] { * | key ... }
	-------------
	alternates   [ -group name ...] regex [ regex ...]
	unalternates [ -group name ...] { * | regex ... }
	-------------
	group        [ -group name ...] {     -rx regex ... | -addr address ... }
	ungroup      [ -group name ...] { * | -rx regex ... | -addr address ... }
	-------------
	lists        [ -group name ...]       regex [ regex ...]
	unlists      [ -group name ...] { * | regex ... }
	-------------
	subscribe    [ -group name ...]       regex [ regex ...]
	unsubscribe  [ -group name ...] { * | regex ... }
add syntax: <mail>@group to send to entire group?

tests: check which dummy() {} functions are still needed

docs/config
	urls aren't linkified https://...

translations
	need printf format ordering doc
	msgid "Option %s has an invalid type %d"
	msgstr "Le type %2$d de l'option %1$s est invalide"

split colours?
	common enum of domains: MT_INDEX, MT_ALIAS, ...
	private set of colours MT_IND_SUBJECT
	cf ExpandoDomain
	separate `struct RegexColorList IndexList`
	probably means init() and cleanup() functions for each library
	what about parsing?

compose: attach lots of files
	select last attachment
	step-shrink the terminal so selection isn't visible
	selection isn't visible!

docs for expando architecture

dialogs 21 * Local variable address stored in non-local memory
	refactor callers
	dynamically allocate data
	delegate ownership to menu?
		probably doesn't make sense for menu to own it

quoted colours not merged correctly
	color quoted default red
	color body green default .
quoted text should be green red

replicate LOCALES_HACK in the tests
	if nobody complains, deprecate the configure option

merge (almost identical)
	struct Regex *regex_new(const char *str, uint32_t flags, struct Buffer *err)
	struct Regex *mutt_regex_new(const char *str, uint32_t flags, struct Buffer *err)

use to disable emojis?
	set ascii_chars = no
from irc
	dmrz	is there a way to just turn of display off emoji in neomutt?
	dmrz	emoji are displaying wrong for me, and i suspect fixing this would be somewhat complicated, so i'll like to just turn them off
	dmrz	("displaying wrong" = covering multiple terminal lines)
	turned out to be a font problem

bisect
	notmuch backend altering headers!
	adding mbox-style "Status: O" and "Tags: inbox"

update gfx repo compose screenshots/etc with preview window
	check docs/website/etc

flatcap/vim-cpp -> neomutt/vim-neomutt-source ?

MT_COLOR_CONCEAL "conceal" -- not just invisible, not _there_
	could use for signatures, headers (weeding), toggle-quoted, etc
	does conceal '.*' leave a blank line?
		probably, should kill the line
	alternatively, leave blank line, but squash multiple concealed lines
	set conceal_level = [0123]
	toggle conceal_level
		to toggle visibility
	set conceal_char = '†'
		cf vim
	set line default colour to CONCEAL?
		but then we lose the colour for when it's not hidden
		have a line-level bool for conceal?

idea from irc:
	index_format expando for the alias short-name
		alias bob "Robert Smith <rs@example.com>"
	gives "bob" in the index
	how?
		need HashTable of alias short names
variant
	apply colours to address lists (e.g. Index, Compose, etc)
	based on patterns, e.g. "in-address-book", "in-address-group-X"

not true, mutt/file.c

	#ifndef O_NOFOLLOW
	#define O_NOFOLLOW 0
	#endif

colour notifications
	might want more distinction for RegexColors
	*which* RegexColor was added / removed
	e.g. { MT_COLOR_BODY, REGEX_ADDED, "http://..." }
		or index into RegexColorList / Array

searching the index with `~i REGEX` matching message ids is problematic
	they often contain regex special characters
	alter the docs to make this clear
add a new syntax to the `~i` pattern...
	`~i TEXT`   -- text is regex
	`~i <TEXT>` -- text is literal

Config system

colour - what happens if you set both (simple/palette) and truecolor?
	we want to share both; if $color_directcolor is set then use
	truecolor, else use (simple/palette)
	avoids the need for multiple theme files
	AttrColor needs link to other AttrColors
		need refcounting

	better that raw | char, because it can be coloured

colour setting
	if rgb but not truecolor => error, unless...
	if colour is already set, don't error, but log

	color object red      green
	color object color123 color   214
	color object #aabbcc  #112233

nntp feature request
	Currently, neomutt downloads newsgroup descriptions from the server only. Would
	there be a chance these descriptions could be saved to a file? This could then
	be used to display descriptions sent by the server (and stored locally) OR not
	sent by the server, in case one wanted to add their own descriptions or even
	change the current ones.
	For example, slrn, by default, adds the descriptions to a .jnewsrc.dsc file
	(basically whatever you name the newsrc file, with a '.dsc' extension and
	resides in the same directory you configure for your .jnewsrc file), in this
	format: <newsgroup>:<description>
	tin, by default, uses a file called 'newsgroups' in the account folder, which
	uses this format: <newsgroup><space><description>

dynamic help bar
	irc: Bombo
	maybe like the 'bind/macro index ...' index,show_in_help or as last arg, 'bind compose <insert> attach-file show_in_help_line'
show_in_help flag should apply to all menus mentioned
we'd have to add a flag to the key bindings,
change the hard-coded bindings to use the flag
should we add to the end of the list, risking not being visible
or the beginning of the list risking other useful stuff getting lost?
unbind would clear the flag
	this would allow user to clear all the help and create their own
	unbind help; rebind help (no flag)

irc suggestion: re learning curve
	personally what would make it less steep would be a "primer HOWTO" with things like
	"How do I compose and send an email?"
	"How do I browse folders?"
	"How do I search in a folder/ in all folders?" and so on
	basically a new user will want to (at least): read incoming email, mark
	them as read/unread, move them to folders (or tag if using notmuch),
	list (index) | directories compose a new message and send it
