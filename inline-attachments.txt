popup window
	does it re-space the underlying menu?
	might be messy if it doesn't
mini-attachment window
	whilst focus is here, cursor is limited to the window
	or does it persist until:
		cursor leaves region?
		another email has 'v' pressed
	'q' / <esc> kills the window, restores the menu
		or 'v' to toggle it?
	normal attachment functions
	viewing an attachment will have to go full-screen

If this is possible, why no message preview?
