window fn pass down top-level wins like MessageWindow
Observer as little as possible: config, not Neo, this window not Neo, etc: Elim neo?
\ need more 2nd-level object to observe -- for commonly-changing objects
add Window.dtor() vs observing NT_WIN_DELETE for most Windows?
Observers: common-changing isn't important  !neo _is_ being an aggregator!
log all successful observations
notify log macro - not compiled/run unless DEBUG?
multiply log levels*10, LL_WINDOW=61, LL_NOTIFY=62
link colours SB_INDICATOR -> INDICATOR, if SB_ isn't set, drop through
add colours to browser, file, dir, folder, nested folder, parent?
\ browser scan local fs for is_mbox, is_maildir, etc => mark and highlight
notify: unify NEW vs ADD, FREE vs DELETE(D), _ALL
DELETE_ALL allows observer to efficiently clear lists
cbar, ibar, pbar -> WT_BAR -> status_op_top()
DEL_ALL doesn't get sent to object, only  parent! - Doc where?
should recalc/repaint ever be called if window isn't visible?  NO
events affecting layout _must_ occur immediately, _unless_ reflow() + WA_FLOW
\ in reflow() if WA_REFLOW, call win->reflow(), _then_ do reflowing
\ => reflow() needs to figure out what to do
Do we need to notify on set_visible()?  vis=false => no more notify
\ set vis=true  notify?  NO?  who care?  notified after win_reflow()
easy:  my command to show all my_vars (or does :set cover it?)
medium: integrate my_vars into config system
DYK: toggle string macro $real_name example, with echo
easy: dsn_* config to enum/slist (comma)?
can mutt_yesno() lookup op in generic map to catch Ctrl-L (OP_REDRAW)
who does repaint for msg window?  if _my_ dlg is visible?
old_focus = set_focus(X); do; set_focus(old_focus)?
breadcrumbs: help>bind>pager>index>compose>pager>index (41 chars)
\ share space with $help, or status bar (index) expand, share msg window
quad, Y/N, multi - print choice, sleep (0.5s), clear - UNLESS macro. HOW?
DON'T update web guide so it shows the old config names, sans "_"
mutt_exit() should notify everyone to allow some cleanup, e.g. backends
