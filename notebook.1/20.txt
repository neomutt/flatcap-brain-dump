Colour questions

signature + underline, fill width?
normal bg set : error msg, red default, does def man merger normal?
empty space after email "~" is it *normal* or default?
only merge colours *if* indicator or if (setcchar/bkgrndset) => 2^16 colours
can *all* colours take attributes?
redefine colours { "name", id, regex[y/n/opt], list*, flags? }
	what about "compose" prefix?
config limits to number of TextSyntax for colouring/search matches?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priv -> Line[] -> TextSyntax[]

display_message -> pager -> custom_redraw -> display_line
display_line -> jump_to_bottom, search, skip quoted, skip headers
next pager, prev page, next line, prev line, top, bottom, half up, half down
hide quoted

:devel -> page describing extra features or "no devel feature enabled"
	OR always enable devel, $enable_devel_features = no (default)
	neo -v	debug -> deve + (ENABLED) - log it too
	#define COLOR(x,y,"desc") discard desc #ifndef DEBUG!

squash rgb check for simple and greyscales first else map RGB to palette

on search print "n matches" and/or "match n of m"
	<search> + <next> behaves oddly w.r.t search context (top m matches)
	<next> should just to *next*, not skip $search_context lines!

use underline to show positions of hidden quoted text?
	to length of first quoted line, max length?  fixed length?

cache processed line for window (-window, +window) or (~100 centred on current position)

add colour "text" for colouring plain attachments?  or use mime-type
color mime-text-plain x y z
or color mime TYPE PATTERH -- easier to parse

toggle_quoted_show_levels doesn't honour 2nd *quoting style*
toggle_quoted_show_levels doesn't work if quote aretn' coloured!
