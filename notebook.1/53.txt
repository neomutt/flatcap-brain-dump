Dispatcher 2

compose: [compose, env, menu, global, tag]
each needs  different window (child of dlg)
dispatcher needs to keep looking up children
keep loop in dlg.  dispatcher handles *all* sub dispatchers (rename to ?)
dlg loop is { redraw(); op=get_key(); dispatchers() } + and dlg - specifics

(1) -> any arbitrary fn could driver any dlg in any way
(2) -> need way to get DOM from window, or the active position init, e.g. Email

(1) drive macro style, need way to tell which window is active
(2) full API
