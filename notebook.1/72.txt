Incremental Search

context config: num of lines surrounding match
	could be "thread" for Index
	likely domain specific

Index, Address Book, Sidebar, Help
add hidden keywords to Help page + translations
They should be matched in search
if translation search *both* keyword strings

help_format rather than fixed?
doesn't help with OP_SIGWINCH retval
still uses pager
means losing headers?
if it uses the Index, then we need to turn off cursor
	and turn <up> info <scroll-up> etc
who else would use this feature?
who else has paged formatted data?
*this* data wouldn't need to be backed by a file

inc-search - highlight match in line.  HOW?
	fuzzy search does 'abc def' match independently?
	are we looking for 'abc.*def' in *one* field, or
	'abc' in *any* field and 'def' in *any* field
libfuzzy needs search string + array of entire fields as string
does Index match against fields that aren't in expando?

Help - change ^X to Ctrl-X, <esc>X to Alt-X
	or Mod-X depending on arch?
	<what-key> too

FIX DPTR
	check path changes
	check address changes
