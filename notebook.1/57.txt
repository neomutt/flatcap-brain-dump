Root, MsgCont [ MsgWin, EnterWin, etc]
who controls height?
only *questions*(msgs) are multiline and ephemeral
reflowing *parent* not enough -- need to reflow grandparent (Root)

push_z() -> reflow, might differe in size, pop_z() too
âˆ€ msg, yn, multi: does each need a wrapper?
Yes, so each Window is trivial, wrapper handles z-order
     so each win can be relocated

can yn/quad/multi share a window? / code?
	each currently has is own event loop

000-999	update checks inc -> calc
	calc gens string -> paint (if diff)
	paint draws string -> X

0 -> 1MiB 1B at a time (oldpos - pos) > inc -> oldpos-pos, calc
