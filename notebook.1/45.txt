Limit

How should <limit> work?  who does the work?  who has the deps?
Index limit using patterns (I-specific)
two parts: compile and execute
does *compile* need any I-specific knowledge? -> gen pattern tree
needs to know if pattern takes args
might need I-specific arg handler

execute - traverse pattern tree
	∀ elem, run test on (pat, arg, data)
	combine results (AND/OR)

domains: Email(Index), Address(Alias), Envelope, Body, EView(collapse, num), Thread(dupe)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

∀ Win  Focus, Cursor, Events
	or save/restore cursor position?  whose??


p - pager_new()		-> init()
dlg_run(p)		- event loop
extract(p)		- retrieve results
free(p)


dlg_run(win) ->
	win needs list of dispatchers
	flags for tagging?
	or pre-list / post-list

dlg_run_single()
	km_dokey() external loop
	then call dlg_run_single()
		- same as, no loop
