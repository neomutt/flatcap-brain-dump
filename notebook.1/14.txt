[MORE MENU STUFF]

NDEBUG => build warnings
turn LL_DEBUG5 - "event handled" into build-dep macro (--debug-events)
give validate access to *value* of changed var
validators *need* subset for checking sibling config var

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pager, toggle strict_threads doesn't refresh index panel
log disp curses, *pause* after *warnings* too - except macros?

new mail cmd, pattern condition, e.g. "~s XYZ"
have multiple new mail cmds, each with regex
match *one* or all?
separate new mail command (external), from X (internal <fns>) -> new mail hook?
need expandos for from, to, subject, etc => one call for each match? too many?

split out dlgs from complex src files - postpone, recvattach (and windows)
