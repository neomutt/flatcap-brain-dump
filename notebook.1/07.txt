IndexSharedData
Sub, Account, Mailbx, Context, Email
Index, IBar, Pager, PBar, Sidebar

Email*Add*: Index: insert into Email array, into virtual array
	(sorted and filtered) When does this happen?  *immediately* or
	cached, waiting for recalc? NO.  immediate -> macro could
	cause Mailbox changed mid-action

Email*Delete*: Index => object will be freed -> immediately
	action required.  Who's observing?  IndexWindow (menu)
	=> immediately, remove objects / refs in array / varray / view
	-> WA_RECALC -> update index numbers, re/thread?  etc
	View objs like thread - update them, but
	leave them in place with NULL Email ptr, that way
	recalc can update without losing open/closed state of folds

Email*Change*: Index - flag EV as out-of-date => RECALC
	Sidebar: Index Email - ignore.  Index Mailbox => what different
	current Mailbox? or current Mailbox has internal changes? BOTH?
	Who needs to know the difference?

date struct date at each level
rev_date ditto reversed
last_date each level sorted by most recent (grand)childn

n -F /dev/null => alias_file = /dev/null - prevent  HOW?
