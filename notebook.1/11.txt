Docs Reorg -- End of manual?

Split out lists : config, functions, commands, colour, screens, hooks, cmdline?
one-line desc + link to more detaul
screens => screen shots / text images + links to other screens!
config one-liner -> translations?
need html & nroff versions.  how?


standalone app built using *.config.c to generate docs
replace makedoc and preprocessing
*need* ab vs a_b explanation
standalone for functions / opcodes too.  need func:opcode:desc triple

Index EL vs TL  (ThreadList) - separation of Data from GUI
do all E have a T?  what if sort != thread?
is T == EV?  Index is list of EV.  what about hidden ones?
(limit / folded thread)  how is lookup done from Index num -> E?
E should be unaware of T.  EL/EA(array), TL/TA
Index = MV, holds EA, VirtA(int) smaller on (limit/folded)
EA in user sort order.  *NO* EA?  Have EVA instead?
what happens when 1 fold is opened?
Thread/Email belong together
T is MX-layer operation
$strict_threads & <break-thread> need to signal someone to update T's

Idx	VirtA	EVA	EA
1	1	EV	E
2	2	EV	E
8	3	EV	E
9	15	EV	E
10	20	EV	E
...


Idx	VirtA	Back (EA)
1	EV vis	E
2+	EV	E
8	EV	E
9	EV hid	E
10	EV	E

parent <- EV -> childnre

sort,limit MV(M)
	{EV,TV}(E)

thread sorting? make, break?
	TL <-	M	-> EL
	E		   E
       / \		   E
      E   E		   E

N AL || A ML || M EL,TC || E

Hash of msg_id for speedy insertion?
