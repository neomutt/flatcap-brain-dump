who owns the new_mail_command?  main()
	fn to setup observers to run, delete notification to cleanup?

Imap complications: after adding emails to new[], changed[], deleted[]
	then could be updated/deleted again before end of fn()
Where does the data go n/c/d[] for check_stats()?
	spread across multiple mailboxes

how does new_mail accumulate multiple mailboxes?  does it matter?
msg_unread will be in MV

1 second timeout (or 1 rep of $timeout) => notification,
compare to $new_mail_timeout
accumulate stats until timeout triggers us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

need n/c/d[] in each *MboxData, put in struct, with fns to manipulate

check stats ∀ M => update several M - across a *single A*
mutt_mailbox_check() does ∀M -> mailbox_check() -> mx_mbox_check()
mx_mbox_check() queues lots of STATUS.  who sends them?  who receives?

eliminate e->active
