MsgWindow
	IS *WA_RECALC* needed at all?

enter_string_full()		(buffer_get_field())
change_flag()
yes_or_no()
buffer_enter_fname() - doesn't take focus!
multichoice()
what_key() - needs focus
menu_redraw_prompt() needs focus
progress / message_bar() needs focus

ask for msgwin()
	should clear up after themselves
	have own event loop

mutt_show_error() (ErrorBuf)
called from Index/Pager/Menu - to refresh
Index "tag-" prefix
Menu "tag-" prefix
log_disp_curses()  error msgs etc
\ mutt_error / warning / message()
Ctrl-L => clear error msg
mutt_clear_error() equiv to clear_line (msgwin) + error_pause()

When opening "?" help, who clears the prev error or "tag-"?
	Index!  clear_error()
Passive: colour + string + clr_to_eol() (wrapping?)
\n => newline, max of 3 lines.  use sparingly

Active: manage window, clearing, painting, wrapping
	as msgwin for resizing => reflow, event loop => redraw

progress_update() needs WINCH check and reflow / repaint!

Win events: will anyone be interested in STATE or DELETE of another win
\ turn state, delete into callback functions
----------------------------------------
/ helpbar_set_text() custom text for temp situations on clear => normal help

* Dynamic help "Yes:Y" (translate), No, Ctrl-G ($abort_key), Enter = Yes/No!
MsgWin controls resizing to fit msg, not the caller. _clear() restores

* need Y,N,Ctrl-G help for choice questions - how?
