IndexDlg -> IndexData
I1,I2,I3 -> IndexData
IndexWin -> IndexData

PagerDlg -> PagerData
P1,P2,P3 -> PagerData
PagerWin -> PagerData

Data isn't complete, no sufficient in itself for recalc/repaint
code need to relinquish *all* data.  window wdata_free() cleans up
Rename IndexDlg code to Index*Loop* âˆ€?  Dialog is *gfx* side
All data needs to be independent of code
	needs setter/getter functions and locking (semaphores)
	any config requires *sub* param (or stored in data)

Can the dlg *own*all* the data?  what if it's passed in?
	same data can't change without locks, repaint needs *all* data

dlg = X_init(); set_data(dlg, Y); run_dlg(dlg); extract(dlg)

Please try "master" before reporting an issue -> ISS_TEMPLATE!
debug_notify - add text header to ever Event object (or obvious magic) (assert match)

put build tops in .git/ have fns() to update/display

for devel options, e.g. mouse have devel CLI arg =>
	can build-in and distribute, but be backwards compatible

new_message_hook to apply headers, tags, move it?  how?
	string of commands <label>inbox<enter> / <move>+work<enter>
	sequentially applied, follow email if moved. hook need pattern
	all matching hooks executed in sequence / how to follow <move>?

after `named-mailbox X +X' what will it take to accept 'X' as
	a mailbox name in all functions/commands?  prob quite a lot

DYK: test your command expansion, prefix with :echo
	AND/OR LOG RAW command before execution -- security prob?
