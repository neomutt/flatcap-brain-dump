Dialog running
Wvin*win = dlg_new() - data where? - opaque ptr
set_params (win, xyz) - or struct in new() - still opaque
rc = dlg_run(win) - calls dlg_push/pop() => event loop somewhere
	\ focussed window? prob
	\ -> window.drive()
extract_results(win, pqr)

dlg_run(win) -> drive() exists, dlg_push(), check focus
event_loop, dlg_pop(), return what?  - result of drive()

event_loop: win_redraw(), getchar(), focus -> drive(ch)
who does 'a' -> OP_A translation?  if we do, we need Menu.type
=> km_dokey() - only relevant for Menus not verify_cert()?!
could drive() do the lookup, i.e. split getch() out of km_dokey()?
how are multikey sequence handled?  does the event loop queue them up?
how are delegation to other windows (e.g. sidebar) handled?
drive(OP) -> lookup table -> action function (shared data)
