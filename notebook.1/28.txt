Attachments / Body -- MimePart

Email -> Body -> next, ->parts
	->TAILQ -> children

How different are compose/recv attachments?
Cam they be merged?  Flag determines which fns are available
Both display a tree of Attach
Compose is mutable (recv can delete X mark as deleted)
Recv needs decryption support

What is AttachPtr?		} which modes need which?
What is AttachCtx?k		} which is *view*info?  all of it?
What's needed to display the tree?
What's needed to pass params to attach_print() etc?
What GUI info is needed?
	tagged, level/depth (for convenience)
When do we use v2r virtual ordering?
	we don't sort or limit attachments
	folding groups

tree chars:
	none	- Top level, no parent
	├─>	child with next sibling
	└─>	child with no next sibling
	│	parent with next sibling		_	without
	│ │	grand-parent has next sibling		_ _	without
	│ │ │	great-grand-parent has next sibling	_ _ _	without

Should attach *insert* at cursor location?  rather than append?
It could insert into existing group (add -> append, insert is new fn)
Is recv attach 'v' folding a group give v little feedback that more exist
Folding attach group - later attach are renumbered, unlike emails
	email jump to hidden -> auto-unfold, not the case for attach
attach_chars: I(nline), A(ttachment) -> icons?
attach_format %X? num children in fold (recv attach) - make default
conditional %M [%M] and/or '+' tree char to show more exist
