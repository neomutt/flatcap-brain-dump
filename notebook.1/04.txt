Enter field anywhere

needs Window - needs to be real
allow *enter* to resize win, with limits and reflow
on WINCH parent & *enter* shouldn't need to be aware of each other
popup win might have diff resize rules
Compose - window for each env item?  how much extra code?
\ would make in-place editing simple?  *

<, >, markers to show text off-screen
add sizes <40|       |16> num char off screen?  colour
need focus colour, even if temp => 0.5s highlight

* extra windows - small, don't need offsets, just win ptrs
alternate: oversize popup, comma or \n separated, expand as necessary (downwards)
