notifications up and down?
Mc -> Mu and Ac  does Au exist?

Au exists but is skipped in enums?
	prevents dupe events at top-level
Au doesn't propagate to N?

OR no notification path from Mc -> Mu
	Mu observes Mc explicitly -> Mc doesn't know about Mu
	Au owns Mu - no notifications, no dupes?

If Mu has homogeneous  children, does it live in Ac?
If Mu has heterogeneous children, where does it live?

New E - EventEmail(new)  E, Mc observed by Mu and re-emitted
GUI observes Mu, sees new E

Config lens-mailbox, my_inbox  imap://imbox  imap://sent
lens_new()  M(LENS)
lens_add(Inbox)	merge Emails[], hash table, etc
lens_add(Sent)  merge Emails[], hash table, etc
	need to know which E's belong to which M's (mdata)

Mu is visible owned by Au
Mc1, Mc2 are hidden, owned by Ai, unless explicitly mailboxes'd

lens backend implements all MXAPI
mdata store children
