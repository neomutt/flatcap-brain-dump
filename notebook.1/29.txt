Attach GUI

If we have a tree of AttachView, which A ops affect the tree?
are there any ops that might cause the tree to get out of sync?

Do any fns take a tree of Attachments?
Which fns take a set of Attachments?
How do we pass AttList without affecting TAILQ?
Could any fns take a hetero list? *single* Atts and *tree* Atts?

Emails tagged -> EmailList (EmailNode -> Email)
Alternatively AttArray
Isn't the EL immutable?  do we need the Lists *insert*ability?
	prob NO => EL should be EA (array)

What's at the base of the Attachment tree?
One Body that owns all the other MIME parts?	(1)
Body Head containing multiple MIME parts	(2)

If fundamental is moveable, replaceable, then it's no different to its siblings (2)
If so, who owns the boundary info for the top-level siblings?
Body owns Parameters, does Email hold the "root" params?  NO


Email -> Body
Body -> TAILQ_HEAD(Body)
AttachCtx -> AttachPrivateData use ARRAY x3 or 4
AttachPtr -> AttachView or BodyView
