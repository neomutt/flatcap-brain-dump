Union Mailbox

Any Mailbox type, any number
e.g. Notmuch query + backing mboxes
Inbox/sent union

Mailbox
	emails[]
	v2r[]
	ops
	owners[] (children[]?)

get_email(n) - honour limit, ownership
get_ops(m,*e*) -> owner(e) -> get_ops()

what type?  UNION?
what mdata - owners[]? etc
is it readonly?  if not need sink for incoming emails
all M members need to be protected - functions for every action
is only 1 mbox r/w?  no notmuch needs all r/w!
mx_mbox_X() handles lookup?
sync() - does it sync 1srt, all mboxes?
which mx_() fns are Email specific?  msg_open(), _close()?
	do they all take an M?  prob Yes

does Mu have an A?  if not how do we enum them?
notmuch opens query, new mail in multiple folders, mark all read, sync
now what?  mbox_sync(Mu) -> âˆ€ children sync (Mc)

do we care about Mc's index for E?
migth change on new mail, etc
header cache needs redirecting to w.r.t. M
