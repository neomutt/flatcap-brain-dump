Searching

Eliminate globals OptSearchInvalid, OptSearchReverse
Rather than search iterate through get_virt_email(),
	pass it an EmailArray
Avoid search/reverse by sorting the array before calling
Avoid $wrap_search by segmenting the array [cur-$,1-cur]
global vars => searching aliases affects email search!
cache searches at MV-level? or AV-level? or NV?
searches don't look in collapsed threads!  $search_deep?
	or make default - only limit it limited?
Eliminate OP_SEARCH_* symbols
split search code along domain lines: MV, M, E, Alias, ???

Theme config file -- all colours, what else?
all gui options
only loaded iff gui is going to be started
How would Account/Mailbox-specific config work?
them, theme-256, theme-rgb.rc?
define std colour with myvars, then source shared config
	e.g. status bar magic
