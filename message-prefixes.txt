Message prefixes

Looking through the messages, I see 86 containing the word "error" and 29 containing "warning".

I'd like to suggest a standard prefix for these messages.
They would be translated separately and added by the logging code.

Prefixes:

    "Error: "
    "Warning: "

The prefixes would be optional (defaulting to on).
The message colours (which default to off) would be independent of the prefixes.

Users could then enable colours and disable the prefixes.

Does this sound useful?
Would this cause problems with translation?

Offer the translators a formatting string:
	snprintf(_("[%s]%s: %s"), ERROR_CODE, ERROR_STRING, MESSAGE);
	ERROR_CODE   = "E123"
	ERROR_STRING = "Error"
	MESSAGE      = "Cannot read file 'x'
the error string and message are independently translated

unify all the errors, warnings, messages
translatable prefix: "Error", etc
if color error|warning|message is defined
	don't use prefix
if $message_chars is defined, use *it* as a prefix
	"❗"/"🚨", "⚠️ ", "ℹ️ " -- or nerdfonts, in colour

Icons could be used elsewhere

Add: Good ✔️ ✅, Bad ❌❎ plus colours

discussion - message strings
	define meaning of 'error' and 'warning'
	demote error -> warning where possible
	demote error/warning to message where possible
counts: (868)
	601 mutt_error()   395 uniq
	 27 mutt_warning()  25 uniq
	240 mutt_message() 154 uniq
possible easy task
	31 * "warning:"
	98 * "error:"
make sure they
	mutt_warning()
	mutt_error()
drop prefix from message and translations
create standard, translated, prefix for all warnings/errors
	prefix isn't displayed if `color error` / `color warning` is set
reword where necessary
	"Error opening 'memory stream'"
	"Error: " + "Can't open 'memory stream'"

demote to warnings
mutt_error(_("Warning: XXX"));

new form for error messages?  two-lines
	first line has error message: "Can't open folder"
	second line has the place: folder, path, url, etc
	simplifies translation strings
	can highlight path
	path less likely to be truncated/wrapped
