IndexRenderData(ALI, ALIAS_NAME) -> name(), name_num()
how to map MT_COLOR_ALIAS_NAME -> (ALI, ALIAS_NAME)?
each colour could have multiple patterns
on "color" add/replace AliasNameColors
on expando_render() call merge_colours(AliasNameColors)
âˆ€ node lookup colour / colour array
(ALI, ALIAS_NAME) -> AliasNameColors
merge colours & attach to Node
colour_observer does what?  owned by whom?
observer on each ExpandoTree on colour changes
flag the tree. on render() recolour if flagged
