Repaint / Event Loop

repaint WA_REPAINT - first paint only (+ cursor vis, pos)
resize (internal)
resize (external) - resize RootWin, recurse, recalc all, repaint all, cursor
sigint -> query_exit should be global fn, OP_INT?
	how to interrupt slow ops?
sigwinch -> NT_RESIZE?
$abort_key OP_ABORT returned
-timeout OP_TIMEOUT, NT_TIMEOUT returned
recalc WA_RECALC slow ops
reflow? WA_REFLOW? we recalc (can be slow) recurse, retval => reflow what?
refresh just before getch call only there?
focus/cursor - post repaint, call repaint without WA_REPAINT
	(separate fn, recursor()?)
OP_REPAINT - not timeout, not keypress -> repaint all?
