Menu

make_entry(menu, line, width, buf) -> text, expando_render()
mdata -> private data
text padded / truncated to width
text contains:
	ascii, unicode, emojid
	tree, nerdfonts, colour, attrs

colours:
	*menu* colour (entire region)
	*row* colour
	*column* colour NO
	*span* colouro

Anything embedded in the text must be *measurable*
expandos colour at the %X-level

Menu colours where it's told to -- *unaware* of columns / expandos

do we want an ExpandoMenu?
expando_menu_new($index_format, IndexFmtDef, IndexRenderDef[])!
No too much config, need observers for unknown objs

Does char_width() work correctly for emojis, nerdfonts, etc?
colours/attrs are zero-width, tree chars are 1 char/column
How do (text,colours/attrs, tree) fix into formatted expandos?

expando *node* has colour/attr, when is it applied?
config DT_EXPANDO + IndexFormatDef
IndexFormatDef "a" -> (ED_ALI, ED_ALIAS_NAME)
	could be multiple expandos linking to *that* pair

"color alias_name fg bg" does what? where?

cfg + IndexFormatDef -> ExpandoTree <- this needs colouring.  how?
ExpandoTree + IndexRenderData -> coloured text
ExpandoTree could be created before or after "color" commands
