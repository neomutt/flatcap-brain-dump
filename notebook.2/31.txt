Parse and Render

Expando: uid, did, render()

Node { type, next, priv*, render() }
ExpandoPriv {did, uid}

Which need colour? of form (prefix,suffix)?
*All* for *custom* render() Node is const, priv isn't

ExpNode for %T		ExpDefn {"T",did,uid,custom_parse()}
Node {did,uid,priv {T stuff(formatting, etc)}}
where/when do prefix/suffix come in?
	separate callback?
wider render()? should it include *line*'s colour? prob NO
RenderNode shadows Node tree - would need to observe Node tree
RenderNode {Buffer*3 (prefix,text,suffix), Node*}
or Node{type,did,uid,Buffer*3(prefix,text,suffix), priv*}
what about Integers? %d, %nd, %.nd, %n.md
	+ justification & padding 0/' '
which nodes have formatting? Exp, Containers
Container {tree,subject} T is fixed size, s is minimise
Container takes %s (subject)'s formatting
Menu maintains arrow string, width and custom render
When format is set, who inserts %^ (arrow)?
	Menu config observer?
if there's an ARROW flag? and %^ isn't already present
maybe used multiple times?!
