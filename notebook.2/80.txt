Help Page Reformat

dump_menu()		3 cols
dump_unbound()		2 cols
dump_message_flags()	2 cols

implementing <sort>
	=> rewriting file each time => lose position
	=> use hacked menu with no selection

kill distinction between "x, macro, full" and "x, full, desc"
struct Columns { char *, char *, char * } + ColumnsArray
colours: binding, function, macro, string(desc), heading
wrapped *stripes* preserve their colour?
	is multiline macro just one stripe colour?

if macro has no description, don't limit its width
add title for main bindings - unclude example e..g
	Pager bindings, e.g. "bind pager H skip-headers"
color code, or example?

add line to web guide?
mutt_help() -> dlg_help()?

*Conceal* - underline entire previous row?
add end-of-row number -> 3 lines elided

| banana                     |

mouse support, click on "(3" to open
does <save-message> save the *concealed* lines?

conceal, only put the underline between text, not indent!
=> tidier for reading
