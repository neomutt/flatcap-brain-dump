Colour

Only index_format, status_format
could extend to folder_, alias_, query_, mailbox_folder_format
line coloured by Menu.color()
status colours are applied to *rendered* string
All expandos (index) are single colour except %s (subject)
subject is [tree chars] + [subject ] 2 colours

special parse for %s - creates two ExpNodes %T%s Tree,Subject!
%T is used, but it doesn't *need* a letter, just a DID/UID
render - draws them separately, generate just give %s
what about formatting?  formatting node?
%30s => %30wide{%T%s}

Only ExpNode is coloured, rest are *line* coloured
Text -> Exp -> Text	RootNode holds line colour? No
	 |
	 V
	 Colour

When are Nodes coloured?
Not, colour inserted at render time
render (ExpNode) -> callback(buf, &colour, flags, did, uid)
Menu.make_entry(n) -> expando_render(RootNode, data, flags)
âˆ€ Node callback() -> [str, colour]
format string, apply colour add to buffer

colour index %{name} / %x / %name fg bg ?
	any valid named expando
%{color:X} #rgb, colorN, red, index_subject(neo name for colour)
${color:none} - conditional colours?  very messy / complicated
