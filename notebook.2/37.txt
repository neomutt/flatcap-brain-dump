Security

secure header fields: copy into encrypted block
	to, cc, subject, reply-to
	still use normal headers for backwards compat
for compat neomutt needs feedback on match
	1) warn if match fails
	2) ✅ against validated fields in header
	3) hide matched headers in enc_block
	   (and substiture subject into header, rather than '...')

feature: separate security page => less clutter (optional)
	"✅" if good signature and decode
	"⚠️" if signature trust isn't good / out-of-date
	"❌" bad signature, matches fail
	on warning - option to expand details
	on error - auto display all info

Option for fields to "secure"
	x="subject, to, cc, reply-to"

Fake header for security, unignore "security"
drop crypt_protected_headers_subject? prob. yes
