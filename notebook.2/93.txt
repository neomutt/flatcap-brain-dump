help sort by keybindings, ideally need raw keyinfo
split into modifier and key
uppercase letter decomposed into <shift> + lower
single modifiers: none, shift, ctrl, alt (mac)
sort by (lower_key, then modifier) but display A (not shift-a)
what are shift,ctrl,alt equivs on Mac?  build-time define?
=> not ^A -> Ctrl-A, not <esc>A -> Alt-A
=> need to *accept* them too

Display: split modifier and key right-justify mod, left-justify key

	      A
	 Ctrl-A
	  Alt-A
	Shift-A
