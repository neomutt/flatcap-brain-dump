Config

main
	gen hea[], either
		ALL (-D)
		SOME (-Q)
	dump_config
		∀ hea (filtered)
	dump_config_new()

mutt_enter_command()
parse_rc_line()
parse_set()
command_set_query()
	set_dump(ONLY_CHANGED)
	set_dump(ALL)
set_dump()
	hea = ALL_CONFIG
dump_config()
	∀ hex (filtered)
msgwin: add_text()


to highlight need
	type (from he->type)
	name (from he->name)
	value (lookup)
	one-liner (from he->cdef)

simple: add_text()

who controls the config/flag for the spager window?
dlg, windo, config, functions
what if dlg wants nowrapping but $wrap is set?
window has settable flags
dlg has functions/observers that can either
	pass through or block features
	=> no config observer on Window
OR a subset, isolated from main config
DLG is handling functions!


use stripe colours for sections in :color ?
