Compose Resizing

Dialog
	Envelope	Envelope
	ABar		PBar		} PBarData
	Attachments	Preview		} PData
	CBar		ABar		} ABarData
			Attachments	} AData
			CBar

Container around {PBar, P, ABar, A}
	reflowed to correct size
	has 4*Window
	Bars are always 1
	Ask how much space is required for P&A
		take into account P-min and/or A-max

Transitions
	config: yes -> no
		no -> yes
	size: large, sufficient, sufficient-1, small, min, min-1

P requirement is num rows, depends on wrapping
	Compose width is already fixed!

Dialog: recalc() - it does resizing?
	It has n rows to distribute
	call env.recalc() if nec => env_rows
	3*Bar => 3 rows => n rows
	halve space, offer to attach_recalc()
	consider $p_min config of 3?
	offer remainder to preview_recalc()
