plugin or markup? -- plugin for MT_COLOR*, markup otherwise?
file or memory? <1MiB -> memory, hide behind get_line()
pre-process?  if so how do we preserve *this* but clear other
input: text\ntext\n...

parse() âˆ€ line: cid(default), TextSyntax[]
	cid is a marker for owned by, could be API ptr
	need separate default in case line starts with other colour

wrapping happens after, involves splitting TS[]
config / color events affect everything -> parse()
window events => rewrapping => first unwrapping
	=> re-read visible part of file

recalc() => parse(), wrap() each if nec
repaint() => paint using TS[] only
2 files? raw, stripped -- one for processing, one for searching
stripped is decoded, stripped of ansi ^H, line endings unified
whitespace unified
only necessary for emails
part of parse processo

get_line(TS) -> buf : 1 stripped line from file
TS refer to file 2 offset
'color' doesn't affect ansi or ^H (hard-coded)
config allow_ansi only affects *email* ansi, not info pages
file/memory => 2 files  / 2 memory or fmemopen() => fp, no "file"
who creates stripeed file?  when?
