How do we keep in sync?

Observers:
Window
Config
Color

Line {TSA, SearchA}
wrapping -> multiple lines

Can we segment line?  YES!

Line represents *one* raw line of text
Markup is non-overlapping subsets of Line
	each has an AttrColor

If we wrap the Line, then recolouring it is hard
If we unwrap, recolour, rewrap we might
	have display problems - text jumping around

Alternative: Segment the Line.  Keep array of {bytes,cols}

Line {offset, TSA, SearchA, SegmentA}
Line: 133 cols, screen width 50, Segments{0, 50, 100}

Spager search works on full Lines
Drawing *virtual* line 32 => count Line Segments
	then display (Line, seg_num) => relative offset


Segments are *byte* counts, corresponding to screen-width *cols*
Segments are affected by $markers, $wrap, $smart_wrap NO

*Pass-in* config values as *flags* -- caller observes config
	=> spager doesn't need ConfigSubset!
