<change-folder-relative>?  syntax ../X ?  CDPATH=".."

<change-folder> make case insensitive?  how? where?

history full dedupe, not just iff matches prev entry

config that *isn't* inheritable?
	$abort_key, DT_STARTUP

build-config script, e.g. BC -rtl remove rtl build config

io_uring??

multiline messasges
	investigate all possible candidates
	elim $sleep_time, [n] for missed messages
	[n] is where there've been multiple set_text()s but only 1 repaint!

split all multichoice "," to ", " + *.po for better wrapping
	no need to improve wrapping, algo first

drop "create folder" on startup with zero - display message
	press "c" to change folder / open a mailbox
