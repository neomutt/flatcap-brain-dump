compose refactor

upstream duplicate lots of config
	214 bools
	25 quad
	9 others

compose dlg+windows
data local to dlg
View data, Constructed Email
sub = N->sub (global config)

<background>
	save config to new Sub
	what happens to the Dlg
	can't pop it, need to hide it

<restore>
	need postpone-like menu
	show window (sub = scoped)
	how is ":set X" handled?
	command is global, sub isn't
	":set" show compose config?  how?

<background> hide window
<send> send email
	clear up sub, tmpfile

backgrounded composes and current index are effectively *tabs*

<show-tabs> button
overwrite top line with names
or show popup menu with names
<show-tabs>i = index
	what about multiple indexes?
<show-tabs>1,2,3 composes
is 1 first compose, or most recent?
background, chronological or most-recently-used
MRU confusing

function to create new Index
how is ":set X" handled?
index-specific? or global?
needs its own sub

Root
	Dlgs (Index)
	Msg (Compose)
	Cli  Index still separate

Index (1)
(Compose1) (2)
(Compose2) (3)
(Compose3) (4)

tab_format_string %To, %Subject, etc

:cmd in compose, use *our* sub
	=> can't do global stuff!
or does it?  only override *send* cfg in *sub*
rest drops through

background compose (treat like tabs)
	<goto-tab>0 -> index
	<goto-tab>1 -> first backgrounded compose
	2 -> second, etc
	use menu for >9

background compose
	enhance select menu to have preview windoow
	select -> fullscreen!

background
	csub: empty, inactive until bg, then full
	isub: full: ask index to populate
	asub: pass-through
what happens to `:set` ?

compose config to hide infrequently-used fields to save space
	set compose_hide = "bcc,reply-to,autocrypt"
	the 'set' function still work
	if the field is set, it's always visible
	or $compose_envelope_hide_empty?

compose: kill leading three spaces in envelope
	unless $x_comment_to and EnvelopeWindowData.is_news
	fix init_header_padding()

use ANSI URL to abbreviate compose fields
	NO, relies on hover showing something useful
	_John_Smith_ with hover of "John Smith <john@example.com>"
	modes on, off, when necessary to fit

compose option to display alias (with hover link?)

compose bug
	E (edit headers) fails if $editor isn't set

add capability to use external browser to attach files in compose
	it returns a list of files
	e.g. vifm

compose menu using its own is_tagged
	use EmailList instead
	+5 others in index. nec?
	change subordinates to take EL

compose expando for filename of email %s for macros
