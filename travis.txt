travis - tag the latest successful build?

TRAVIS_BRANCH          For builds not triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch currently being built; whereas for builds triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch targeted by the pull request (in many cases this will be master).
TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR       The absolute path to the directory where the repository being built has been copied on the worker.
TRAVIS_BUILD_ID        The id of the current build that Travis CI uses internally.
TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER    The number of the current build (for example, "4").
TRAVIS_COMMIT          The commit that the current build is testing.
TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE    The range of commits that were included in the push or pull request.
TRAVIS_JOB_ID          The id of the current job that Travis CI uses internally.
TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER      The number of the current job (for example, "4.1").
TRAVIS_OS_NAME         On multi-OS builds, this value indicates the platform the job is running on. Values are linux and osx currently, to be extended in the future.
TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST    The pull request number if the current job is a pull request, "false" if it’s not a pull request.
TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG       The slug (in form  owner_name/repo_name) of the repository currently being built. (for example, "travis-ci/travis-build").
TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS Whether or not encrypted environment vars are being used. This value is either "true" or "false".
TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT     is set to 0 if the build is successful and 1 if the build is broken.
TRAVIS_TAG             If the current build for a tag, this includes the tag’s name.

Disabling the Subsequent Test Run

Due to the way that Travis CI addons operate, your standard script stage (i.e.
your tests) will run after the Coverity Scan analysis completes. In order to
avoid this, you can modify your script directive in .travis.yml.

The COVERITY_SCAN_BRANCH environment variable will be set to 1 when the
Coverity Scan addon is in operation. Therefore, you might change your script
from

script: make

to

script: if [ "${COVERITY_SCAN_BRANCH}" != 1 ]; then make ; fi

what should we build on a new tag being pushed?
	tags => neomutt release => full spread?

travis -- test docs validation
	test make install
	compare to known list of installed files

doc travis build system
	push, pr, txt files, .yml
	explain why centralised
	explain why not container build

disable docs

travis-build
	allow line comments starting #

travis build install/use chronic
	esp. for ./configure

should travis main build do docs, po too?

travis
	test new (faster) containers
	reduce push/PR to ONE build

travis check shell/perl scripts

validate the build script itself

make sure travis builds ALL docs (and validates)
	not just configured features

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the moment, we use travis to build our code. But travis runs at the moment
on every commit - even when only documentation stuff was edited.

Of course we can use [ci skip] in the commit message to tell what to ignore -
but some people (including me) keep forgetting that.

So, i think it would be useful, if we added some check to our build file which
skips the rest of the build if only certain files were edited.

I guess we could even go so far and ignore every commit in which no *.c or *.h
file was edited?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three things to be built: code, docs, translations.

The docs and translations depend on the code.
The contrib dir can't be checked, so can be ignored.

Travis tells us what's changed since the last build in $TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE.
This means we have enough information to work out which files have changed.
With a little light editing of the build script, we should be able to reduce
the load on travis.

If changes occur in:

	contrib/ -- do nothing at all
	doc/ -- configure and build docs
	po/ -- configure and build translations

Otherwise build everything.

Currently, the build script, does two builds (controlled by the txt files in
the build repo.)
The build is configured with --disable-doc --disable-po for speed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things we can build/test:

	compile code (make) (build sets defined in travis-build)
	test install (make install, make uninstall)
	build/validate docs
	compile/validate translations
	validate scripts (shell, perl)

Riskier things we can do:

	Look for whitespace errors

travis xenial - try more compiler flags

travis propagate idn2 fixes across all config
