'eval' command prefix for controlled evaluation of backticks, etc
	or 'noeval' command => literal string

create mechanism for *literal* set variable
	set pass = literal< ... >
	how do you know where it ends?
	perhaps literal must be the last thing on the line?
	would the variable need to know?

create a literal string marker:
	set x = /Don't "shoot"?/
or something like vim's unmagic \V
