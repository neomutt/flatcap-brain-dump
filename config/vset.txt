struct {type, hash, name, union {vars}}
OPT_INT(Var)
get_int_opt(name|id)
type includes "my_"-ness
who holds the vars?
get(NULL, name) => default?
hash inside or out, or both. BOTH
HASH *vars
get_name (id)
get_hash(name)
get_var(name|id)
set_var(name|id, var)
some vars need a validator
variable sets know their parent
set variables via a function() -> notifications
get variables direct from their Var
variables don't know about refreshing
where are validators / notifications stored?
	globally (on default config-set)
	per-config-set (allow overrides)
key my_vars in separate set?

functions per set, per type
	setter
	getter
	validator
set by string (from config)
get by type of user's choice
internal getters: string, int, bool, void*
overridden getter returns "Var"?
then coerced to type?

hc_init()
	register_type(DT_HCACHE, ops)
parse_set()
	-> hc_set(string)
	-> hc_validator(string)
validator per type
REQUIRE get_str ∀ types

have separate int/uint variable types?
	which variables need negative values?

have a 'time' variable type
	allows setting: x=30m (minutes), etc
	may not be worth it, most times are sub-1minute

strdup? or does the config_set take ownership?

use high bits of 'type' to save free()/don't free() of a string

how does 'reset' work?	where is the original value stored?
do we keep it in the hash elem?
a "parent" config set of original values?
how many config values are changed?
too much overhead?
hashelems won't be constant
	init var  == address1
	set var	  == address2
	set var	  == address2
	reset var == address1
too much overhead?

how are variables read?
macro doesn't work if things might be overridden/reset
	can't cache address of HashElem
	unless we have a RESET flag
hash id may not be unique
need to work with string representation
get_bool("sidebar_visible")
horrendous duplication of strings?

reset means:
	keep the old value
	or remember who owns the variable

get/set
	hash = overhead looking up string when USING the variable
	vars = overhead looking up string when setting variables

notifications to invalidate HashElems?
	too complicated

caching options could be account-local
	header cache for local mboxes
	body cache too for remote mboxes

parse_set
	get hashelem
	get id from he
	lookup str_set
	set_set(he, value)

base types
	bool, num, str, quad
	mutt -D ∀ dump specific
	else str_get

coercion hc_get_int(he)

dropping hash means losing the trapping of set-value
	we lose the ability to trigger notifications

how many variables are going to be account-specific?

how will +=, -=, *=, /=, ^= work?

path variable type?  subtype of string?
	flags: FILE, DIR (or both)
	does the setting engine need to know
mailbox variable type?	subtype of string?
command variable type?	subtype of string?
	more scrutiny for setting?

for variables that have their initial value set at runtime,
set a flag in the VariableDef to free() the string at shutdown

set all setters with the wrong DT_*


for account vars
set var => AC0 set var

for non-ac vars
set var -> base set var
account AC1 set var => var set var

variable: Base or Account	VB	VA
Set by: user/config or code	SU	SC
type value: real, inherited	TR	TI
read by user(std i/face), code	RU	RC

When is AC0 setup?  After init_vars()
	allows modules to set any defaults
init_vars()
	reg_type()
	reg_vars()
create AC0
load user config


no inheritance - copy at AC creation
	=> create AC0 after user config
set with no AC -> goes where?
	Base => nobody sees it  NO
	AC0 => won't get used  NO
	AC(cur) => gets used  YES

Config		Create AC0(empty)
	x;y;z -> base
AC1 a;b;c -> AC1 just those settings
	p;q;r -> base

AC0 no settings, some mailboxes
AC1 some settings, specified mailboxes
then fill out unset vars from base


Difference between
1) set var
2) account name set var
3) account - set var  (magic name)
	useful for hooks!

does it matter when they happen?
	startup, preAC, postAC
	unused AC value, set AC value


if AC holds(HE*), then inheritance works
	get_char(ctx->ac->sb_div)
1) set base (maybe inherited by many)
2) set specific AC
3) set current AC
=> types need (HE*) setters/getters

AC0 only container "inherit" vars
new account coped AC0 verbatim

to generate AC0, need lookup table for struct
list of strings, index is offset into AC struct


copying won't give stable address
!!! ACs => allow_dupes
        => slower lookups
prefix AC name to variable AC:var
allow setting vars thus

1) set var (base var)
2) set name:var (spec ac)
3) set -:var (current ac)
3') set :var (current ac)
account x
        set y=z
account / EOF
=> set x:y=z
(try 'x:y' else 'y')

to generate AC, create new set of named(prefixed)
variables of type "inherit".  AC struct holds pointers
HEs are fixed/static for lifetime of AC => bond between
inheritable vars and AC struct

new AC-spec var => add struct member
add to lookup string table

what about nested config sets?
do CSs have a list of children?
can CSs be freed recursively?
do HE-inherit have an HE ptr inside?
for about CS inheritance


set "x:var" must exist
if not check "var" & error


Where are the values of inherited variables?
Internal?


All config names are backed by a real variable
(not centralised), some may be global (extern)

All AC config names are internal to the hash => only
accessible via HE
get_int(HE) may use value of get inherited value

who owns AC ptrs?  buffy
how do we get from sidebar-open to AC?
sb_open => buffy -> AC update ctx

what happens if *first* AC command is
        account x set y=z
need to create ACx first

What about
        set x:y = z   FAIL? YES
require AC command first

inherit HE is bit-flag over var type

what about named mailboxes / notmuch
where do they fit in?

Do AC vars need real backing?
If AC vars are only HE, do ptr persistence matter?
caching an AC ptr isn't useful
AC could change


Do we need the base hash for the initial version?
can we just use mutt_config.c as before?

inherited HEs *need* ptr to parent *and* embedded value
when "reset" need both

do we make the HE bigger of alloc lots of small mem blocks
or AC object has lookup table of what?
given an HE* we can't tell anything about the variable

:reset :var
ctx->buffy->AC
AC needs a hash table of its own
could have large HEs
AC HE has
	-> HE parent
	value
	type/flags
AC hash var -> HE
destroy (HE->value), NULL
type -> inherited
notify

reset base of inherited variable
how are ACs notified?
ACs need to be listeners of the base


register types
∀ module register vars
(mutt_config.c line)

var has
	name
	type (+flags)
	variable ->
	initial value

hash table has 1 HE per variable
HE has ->mutt_config.c type

1) read config: set originary vars
name(hashed) -> HE			} repeat
HE->type->set_string(value)		}

2) dump_config, e.g mutt -D
walk hash
∀ HE save name, value
sort & print
sort account info last
'-v' -> print inherited values
(commented out)

:reset var  /  :set var
ctx hashvar -> HE
destroy (HE->variable), NULL
copy initial value
notify (var, (RE)SET)

AC listener
has var -> HE  hash(ACName:var)
if (he->type == inherited)
notify (var, (RE)set)


notifyees can cache opaque HE ptrs
AC_notify("sb_sep") -> HE
AC_notify could do with an enum

mutt -D who's responsible for quoting/escaping values?
flag on type code or the dump code
probably the dump code

scope "my_vars" with "_my:"?
demos of all dump options
e.g. only if changed
allow my:var?  also?

unary operators for DT_PATH
	'+', '=' expand to $folder
=> not a subclass of DT_STR

delete from set when destroying AC
need separate notification
=> need create notification
only happens after initial setup


test/bool.c code
test/bool.txt expected output

validator called twice with native set
move var defs into Cset helps with isolation testing

notifications for new var, del var & shutdown, startup
=> allow others to cache if nec

unary operator ':' -> AC scope

variable def configure writer to generate correctly escaped config file

scoped myL variable should sort last in "mutt -D"
vars; AC vars; my vars


operators => transitivity
x = y + z
means need a tmp var for (y+z) of typeof(x)

need to support synonyns (initially)
highbit flag to redirect

test setting existing string/addrs to NULL
to free their resources
non-null string validator?
	num_positive validator
	num_non_zero
flags for common string validation (or number)
validator before !NULL test

test register of invalid types
test Cset + heavy overflow
test ac


setter set error message but return true
=> warning for user
need buffer_is_empty()

define types
	INT8,16,32,64
	signed/unsigned
one num type with size flags

check expected failure messages

variable operations
all must support
	'='
	set by string
	get by string (dump, completion)
flags on type defns '+=' is meaningful to this type
	num += addition
	string += concat
	list += append list
		flags: are lists sorted or config-order
Ops +, -, *, ^, /, !

Unary operators?
	-X
	!X
	"set"?
numX = -numY
boolX = !boolY
boolX = stringY (if set) }- perhaps these should be ()d
boolX = numZ (non-zero)  }  to highlight booliness

numY, BoolY, stringY, numZ -- actually need to be '&variable'
	or do they?
	set timeout = variable_name
		isn't ambiguous
	anything that's a variable name (that's not quoted) should be expanded
	numbers aren't variables

call num_operation(HE, OP_ADD, str_val)

declare global vars const extern (not allowed)
only allow setters to change
WHERE -> EXTERN

hcache/vars.h - *its* globals, extern
hcache/vars.c - *its* var array [ | | | ]

hash table means sorting entries before completion
quicker to walk, filter, sort, display

a lot of crypto globals could be private to /ncrypt

custom reset functions (per type)

command variable - must exist?
need to parse first element

listeners need to lookup their variable / HE

Tests:
	compiler
	valgrind
	coverity
	coveralls
	iwyu

variable flags
easier than a validator
	int:
		positive
		non-zero (cardinal)
	string:
		not empty

need mutt deps to be isolated so we can build
a variable rig without mutt proper
(or compat #defines for mutt_strdup, FREE)

for failing var ops, put message in buffer
if no buffer, log it
log it anyway
	hmm... we expect the called to display/log the message

create AC => dupe all members?
YES, then create AC
=> dupe all members
if var are AC-specific can the base members
ever be set?  yes, when they're common to all AC


Can get from: str <--> HE --> var

set non-ac-var		val in base
set ac-var		val in base
ac1 set ac-var		val in ac1
reset non-ac-var	init val in base
reset ac-var		init val in base
ac1 reset ac-var	base val in ac1


default ac is pointer to base (if it needs to exist)
no ac commands, everything works as usual
get_bool(AC->sb_visible)
Context ->ac = base
	->ac = ac1
all gets/sets through (ctx->ac)

ac contains dummy links for unset vars
	=> persistence of HE for lifetime of AC


can *any* variable be ac-specific?
no.  code would need to know
ac obj has HE ptrs ∀ ac-vars
for rest, *still* means, 400 global variables!
or 400 constants => no hash table => array
array => bunching of constants for AC-vars


HE or HE->data?

{ name, type, varptr, initial }
{ ...
unique ID?

can we eliminate all L10N strings from config/?
what about other libs?
what about type-specific errors?

too big, invalid format, etc
encode errorcodes in pointers

should any of the native functions display messages?
	probably yes.  the validator could still fail

consider AC listening to CS for scenario when
	AC is inheriting
	CS gets set
	AC might need to notify someone

finally move all test code to separate repo "test-config"

clang build demo

teach parse_set about curly quotes
cut'n'paste from guide

vote move #ifdef/#include
into header file, #ifndef

drop NONULL -- all strings are defined in type

what other strings would need protecting?
#define EMPTY_STRING ""
or const! free checks for empty string


notmuch users' team
ping them on changes


why is safe_free(void*) not (void**)? test

config (code) only allows one level of inheritance?
	expand?

export text values from config, e.g. "yes", "no"
	exporting means they'll need NULL terminating
	and the array_size's adjusting

store the component in the config set for each config item, e.g.
	Sidebar:
		sidebar_width
		sidebar_visible
	Imap:
		imap_user
		imap_pass
	so that the config could be dumped by component?
