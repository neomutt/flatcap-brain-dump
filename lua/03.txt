Lua3

Error handling
--------------

retval 0 success, n error
errors will differ depending on operation
could generate msg as source and return (error code, msg)
or return just error code ahd ahve perror() fn to generate msg


Alter MenuFuncOp, OP_LUA_ALLOWED => save to run *live*
	anything else would need to be queued and lua return first
