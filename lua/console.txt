lua console

redirect print
output is redirected to a file
file is used to populate a Menu
Menu tracks last entry `tail -f`
lua script can enable/disable console with a command
or reset it!
console output file is temp (auto-deleted)
unless user saves it
timestamped log

pager live update
focus follows additions

disabled by default?

make it an actual *console*
text extry area, where you type in lua
results go to main window

focus my need to stay on Index Dialog so that NeoMutt doesn't notice
that might mean Index needs a new function dispatcher that redirects to Lua Dialog

:lua-console
	expando: date, time, msg?

single Window in IndexDlg
wdata -> Menu, mdata->lua log (info)
$lua_log_level, $lua_log_file
:lua-console [show|hide|reset|toggle]
$lua_console_format: date, time, level, msg
$lua_console_var_format?

console - expand tabs

needs fns to navigate console - who processes them?
	global?!
	dedicated lua_function_dispatcher() - prob

Lua console :lua-console or bool $lua_console

modal: Menu or Pager, <quit>

non-modal: new Window, below or to right of Index/Pager
	follows output as lua calls refresh
	need way to focus it: <enter-lua-console> / <quit>
	doesn't affect visibility, but allows user to navigate
