Lua 1

Top-level objects: neomutt, config, index (1 per dlg)
Do we need an umbrella object?  neo.x, .y, .z?
Does it matter?  scripts are "captive" to NeoMutt

contrib scripts need:
	name, author(s), license, homepage, description

should dlgs offer fns by OpX?
OpMenu obj? or just one big set of fns?

Info page - show loaded scripts. :lua?
"window-hook index lua-source..." HOW?

NEOMUTT
-------
(root of DOM)
account
mailbox
email
address
navigation between
some directions not possible

DLGS/WINDOWS?
-------------
(wrapper to Windows)
get_current() -> IndexDlg *object*
each obj has base class
name, focused/active
(might not be active if stacked)
enumerate? -> breadcrumbs
bindings[], functions[]
name(), enum *fns*, fn groups
many dlgs are -> SimplePagerWin

COLOURS
-------
(wrapper to theming)
get/set/+=/-=/(color or attrs)
enumerate objs/lists
uncolor, unattr (mono?)

ALIASES
-------
(wrapper to aliases)
enumerate, search
alias obj[]

SIDEBAR (window)
-------
wrapper to sidebar (mailbox)
enum Mailboxes
get/set format
custom colours
custom sorting
custom display string
width => wrapper to cfg, etc

----------------------------------------

lua interaction with neo prompts: HOW?
text entry, multi-choice, y/n, etc
pass response table to Neo?
Neo prompts need unique ids

∀ objects properties()
	=> table of class members that can be accessed
	with get_X() -> read only
