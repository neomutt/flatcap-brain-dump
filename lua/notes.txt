lua includes deprecated commands
	sidebar_whitelist
	unsidebar_whitelist

sleep command (allow fractions of seconds)

alter package path in NeoMutt to include /usr/share/neomutt/lua
	for shared scripts

need helper code for each dialog
	index_helper knows about Mailbox/Emails etc

state persists between scriptsQUAD_ASKYES
(config lua_persist=yes?)
`:lua-reset` to clear state

index_helper - perform actions on:
	Mailbox(View), Thread, Email(View)
	Menu/navigation

can't change dialogs, because it's single-threaded
*could* change Mailboxes as long as we remain in the Index

*could* queue up changes
Index
	<enter-command>lua-source apple.lua<enter>
apple.lua
	find email
	alter email headers
	push <display-message>
	push banana.lua
	[end]
NeoMutt
	queue: open Pager
	queue: run banana.lua
	[queue empty]
banana.lua
	<skip-headers>
	[end]

use inheritance from Mailbox to
	ImapMailbox
	MaildirMailbox
	etc
Same for all Object + ObjectData

cycler script - cycle between a set of values
	cycler("sidebar_width", 30, 60, 90)
	if value is in list, pick next value (cycling round)
	if value is not in list, pick first value

have an Index object representing the IndexDialog, etc
	it can perform <function>s
		which return enum FunctionRetval
	it can give out state info

global
	add sleep() function (float val)
	add enter_string()
	add multi_choice()
	add yes_or_no()

lua-reset -- reset entire state
