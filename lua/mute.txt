mute conversations in neomutt

In Neomutt:
	<limit-add-email>	or	<hide-email>
	<limit-add-thread>		<hide-thread>
	hide email(s)
emails disappear from display
	<limit>.	restores	<unhide-all>?

new mail arrives (hide-email vs hide-thread)
	if email is hidden,  new reply is visible?
	if thread is hidden, new reply isn't visible?

need more options:
	hide this email only
	hide this email and all its replies in the future
on reply arriving
	hide it too
	show only new arrival
	reshow entire thread

hiding an email/thread is temporary
calling a script to do it can persist the info (file/db)

are muted emails separate from limited emails?
yes, should be.  this allows independently using limit

script on mailbox-hook
Mailbox is populated, but not yet displayed (pre-refresh())
script can inspect all emails

script: mute-conversation can use external sources
	e.g. flat file, rules in config, database
to determine which emails to hide

bind key to lua-script + focused object. how?
	*functions* can't take params, so how?
how would this be different to just <enter-command>lua-source file.lua<enter> ?
any script should be given: current object pointer (and type)
script needs locale info: Index Dialog, Alias Dialog, Compose Dialog
script: assert(IndexDialog)

flat text file might be simpler for the user to maintain
	{email,thread}  message-id      {new-hide,new-show-only,new-show-thread}
	{date}          0000-00-00      {new-hide,new-show-only,new-show-thread}
	pattern         neomutt-pattern {new-hide,new-show-only,new-show-thread}

hiding rules:
	hide by msg-id
	hide by date

allow adding custom rules
	=> custom keywords in file/db

does mute hide? or just quieten?
	option?
hide => {new-hide,new-show-only,new-show-thread}
quieten => no options

script needs to be able to mark emails as read
	=> <exit> wouldn't commit changes

when new mail arrives, need to apply rules to it
