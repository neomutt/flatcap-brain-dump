Logging

log raw lua command entered

where? which direction? of what?

NeoMutt: hard vs soft fail

hard => lua_error() -> abort + log to file
	non-existent config/function (knowable in advance)
	config validation failure?
	function failure
soft => log to file
	function failure
debug -> neo log, lua log file
	lua_log (LL_*)
	neo_log (conditional on level)
	lua file (always)

doc which functions/actions might log/file/abort (killing script)

Lua: output to: user, neolog, lua log
	message, warning, error -> user, neo, lua
	print, log -> neo(conf), lua(always)

NeoMutt creates tempfile lua log, persistent between lua calls
can be viewed in :lua-console, can  be cleared/reset
can be saved to a custom file, or config: lua_log_file
if $llf is set log there, adding only
if $llf, does log-reset do anything?  YES
	keep a marker of log file's size
	console displays everything after this marker
	reset sets new highwater mark
