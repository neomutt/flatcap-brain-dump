Lua5

∀ object: get_functions() -> table of approved fns
if user does <change-folder> from script,
use lua_error() as a cutout - it kills the script,
we log the termination

lua-source: predefined path
or $lua_source_path (or $lua_path?)
at lua startup / reset prepend path to [package.path]
default to ".:~/.config/neomutt/lua:/usr/share/neomutt/lua"
	cf mailcap_path
DT_STARTUP_ONLY

symlink both dirs to ~/lua for convenience
startup only *unless* we preserve orig [package.path]

lua-mode: run lua cmds without "lua" prefix
until "exit" or Ctrl-D.  needs dedicated history!
put :lua X into HIST_LUA *too*
lua-mode show lua console

console - expand tabs
userdata_get_type -> "Index" or define consts

index.function() no params needed, BUT
could take (NUM) as a repeat count
