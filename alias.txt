Alias API -- Refactor Alias Handling

- Create an Alias library -- separate the code from the rest of NeoMutt
- Create an API (list of functions) that everyone uses

This library should be only be dependent on libmutt and libemail.

The library only needs to store and serve up the aliases and their associated
data.  Parsing the config file should remain part of the NeoMutt code.

Separating the alias code will make it easier to test and maintain.

---

An "alias" is a short name you can assign to an email address to save you having
to remember it.  NeoMutt's config looks like this:

```
alias jd  John Doe <john.doe42@example.com>  # Met in Vegas
```

Extra info:
- aliases can be put in groups ("alias -group")
- an alias can refer to multiple addresses ("alias x, y, ...")
- an alias can refer to the user ("alternates")
- patterns can check if the address:
  - is an alias
  - is to the user
  - is a mailing list

Once complete, there are some optional extra challenges:
- Improve the storage of aliases (currently a branched linked list)
- Add tagging/labelling to the aliases
- Create a database backend, e.g. sqlite

Ideas for Aliases

account-specific aliases
	where do they get saved?
	ac-spec file, if not, then global file

librarify alias code -- only dep on addr code and idna

change aliases from list to hash
	how big?
	100s?

remote config option
	alias files

special reader for alias file, that parses comments, e.g.
	# labels:red,blue,green phone:'1234'
	or json (one-line)

when parsing aliases, store which file they came from
when displaying aliases:
	if one file, just display a list
	if multiple files, use the sidebar
		All aliases
		- File1
		- File2
	if labels exist, use the sidebar
		Unlabelled
		Labelled
		- Label1
		- Label2
	Allow the user to add to label-combination list

add expandos for "file" and "label"
add function <display-alias> to show a persons complete details
allow <modify-label> function
add function <add-metadata> -- free-form text field in editor
	Alias: flatcap
	Real Name: Richard Russon
	Labels: self, neomutt
	free form text

turn into an "alias" module (.so)
create an ldap alias module
	initially read-only
sql/sqlite backend

scripts to export db contents as json, csv, text

api
	functions to query aliases

alias file as definitive source
if this becomes a list, then where do we save?
	first? last?
header: generated file - do we store other comments?
	how?  where?
needs to work as normal alias file
ALIAS SHORT NAME1 NAME2 ... <EMAIL> # COMMENT
encode extra data into comment, in form
	tag:"data" [tag:...]
{tag/group/label} nick, irc, addr, etc
allow embedded '\n'
when do aliases get saved?
	on creation?  on exit?  on command?
functions
	get alias by name
	get all -> R/O
	set_{short|name|comment|email}
	get_{short|name|comment|email}
	get fields -> list of extra data
	get field(a, fname)
	count aliaes
	add alias
	del alias
create sidebar ∀ fields
	split display
	sidebar with groups/tags
	index 1-line list of aliases
	pager extra data
for completion or display, get all data then filter, etc
	data can't be opaque
tag for "self"
need fn to get list of groups for an EmailList
	hard.  iterate through list instead

when you create an alias, it only offers you the "from" (or "reply-to")
	can't alias other recipients

3 parts:
	pure - add,remove,free,etc
	file - read file, parse line, write file
	menu - r/o selection, r/w editing

commands: alias, group, alternates, lists, subscribe
files: alias.[ch], addrbook.[ch], init.[ch]
Contacts with sidebar could display: alternates, mailing lists

tag-alias doesn't work in index or query menus
limit command
	match patterns against fields
	~f (from) alias name
	~t (to)   to address
	~y (tags)
	~m (message number)
	~T tagged
	~D deleted
	~s (subject) comments
parse 'magic' comment string 'labels=label[,label[,...]]'
add labels field to Alias
add labels expando to $alias_format
add sidebar to alias, fields:
	All Aliases, Unlabelled, Self, Labels: tag1, tag2, ...
	auto-width to match labels
self is all matching alternates, but not unalternates
functions
	tag-pattern
	delete-pattern
	undelete-pattern
add sort function
add comment sort option
`:alias` command opens addrbook (and does what?)
	or `<addrbook-open>`
expando %f flag: 'S' for 'Self' (overridden by 'D')
	check alternates/unalternates
//QWQ const size_t len = strlen(buf); // for efficiency
menu cursor position isn't preserved on updates (insertion/deletion)
