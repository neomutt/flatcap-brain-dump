bug: can't copy/save email without decrypting it

rhel needs libidn-devel

have a different index_format for indicator line?

easy: split mutt_lock_file (and unlock)
	or drop flock()
	almost no overlap of code
	fix configure fcntl or flock, not both

connections
	raw - fd - host, port
	ssl - encryption - certs
	imap - login - user, pass
	tunnel?
	who negotiates ssl, sasl?
	how does opportunistic ssl work?

create mechanism for *literal* set variable
	set pass = literal< ... >
	how do you know where it ends?
	perhaps literal must be the last thing on the line?
	would the variable need to know?

kill all function names with plural objects
	new_body() OK
	delete_bodies() BAD
	hard to search for similar functions

use summary log for informational info
	Sent email "Subject" to

	attach mac text file (CR) OK
	neomutt eats all CRs

		ERROR (see errno)
			or have a simplified error

	append_file("name", buffer)
	for functions that don't need to do anything else

easy task: merge:
	mutt_concat_path 14 uses
	mutt_concatn_path 1 use

rfc822 needs renaming.  that rfc was obsolete long ago

easy: split mutt_lock_file() and unlock
	into flock() and fcntl() versions
	only allow/build one
	configure option --locking=[flock|fcntl] ?

static functions with leading _
	add to style guide

add dependency info to library doxy pages
	either a text list, or
	a dot diagram

turn some config vars into (string) lists
	hidden_tags (separator = ',')
	mailcap_path (separator = ':')
	send_charset (separator = ':')
	split at config level, then call the validator on each list item

all global variables should be set using the config mechanism
	therefore changes to globals would trigger notifications
	this means we need fake "config" items
	(tagged to be invisible to the user)
	like all the "pseudo" bool values

easy: replace mbtowc() with mbrtowc() in my_width()
	only used in one place
	man page says: "The function mbrtowc(3) provides a better interface to the same functionality"

lib/address.c and rfc822.c
	NOBODY is using error codes:
		ERR_BAD_ADDR_SPEC
		ERR_BAD_ROUTE
		ERR_BAD_ROUTE_ADDR
		ERR_MEMORY
		ERR_MISMATCH_PAREN
		ERR_MISMATCH_QUOTE
	or globals:
		RFC822Error
		rfc822_error()
	functions aren't resetting error code on success
drop them?

research all RFCs relating to email, etc
	graph of dependencies / obsoletes

eliminate all static variables in functions
	starting with the libraries

how do we test the static functions in the libraries?
	make *everything* public?
	#ifndef TESTING
	#define STATIC static
	#endif
if not, they must be completely robust

up-to-date list of functions/data for each library, split into:
	public functions/data
	static functions/data
one (background?) colour for each library
one shared colour for ALL static functions
use ctags to generate lists

use alarm(2) to stop DNS from taking too long?
	see sigaction(), alarm() in send_msg() in sendlib.c
	extract to a function in signal.c
	user message, or just debug message?

move some address functions to lib
	only dependent on struct Address
	parse string
	maintain address LIST
	check membership of a list
	functions in hdrline.c

move lib/memory NLS stuff to lib/message.[ch]
	and update libmutt-deps.gv

create a literal string marker:
	set x = /Don't "shoot"?/
or something like vim's unmagic \V

docs, etc: drop "All mail clients suck..." quote from m.e.

iptostring
	unsigned param, no int!

shadow param warnings in crypt.c!
	check build options
	build script and travis

kill ISSPACE macro -- no benefit to having it
	what about the (unsigned char*) cast in it?

find all doxy comments with "note" in them -> @note

xdg/neomutt/CONFIG
	config is standard, rather than (or as well as) neomuttrc

mutt_account_tourl Account arg should be const

move lib doxygen notes to header file?

tests on lib should also be run on 32-bit arch

2017-09-27 #mutt
<fire2199> by the way... why is there not a pre-defined variable for setting the config folder?

variables: buf vs buff vs buffer (distinct from Buffer)

pgp-hook is synonym of crypt-hook
	needs deprecating, too

find "sprintf(x->data" for buffers -> buffer_printf

update _dev/signing.md
	wget https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/archive/neomutt-20170912.tar.gz

	test using build user

change travis build to check for whitespace errors
	tabs, trailing whitespace
	fail before starting build
which branches?
	master, travis, devel/* issue/*, coverity
	everything except pull-requests (some leniency)
		WARN though
push to branches, test BEFORE & FAIL
pull request test AFTER and WARN

change feature neomuttrc examples to be useful working versions

rebuild all of mutt-*, neomutt-* binaries
	make sure they all use /etc /usr
	symlink, or put config so that mutt has good defaults

Create LTS release branched from 2017-09-12
	until all big features are done
Change all version strings to YYYY-MM-DD rather than YYYYMMDD?

Easy task
	refactor parse_hooks to use (new) flags in init.h
	e.g. TAKES_PATTERN, TAKES_REGEX

install: do we need *.dist any more
	packages keep track if things have changed

mutt -DX read config and display deprecated options
	and their replacements

distro:
	update fedora, copr pages
	rewrite copr page
		news
		links to features

notmuch: what do users do externally?
	can these actions be done using NM API?
	before neomutt -> startup-hook
	periodic -> timeout-hook
	after neomutt -> shutdown-hook
	what do we need to do?
	where would the code fit in?

docs - General build
	config options
	make targets
	install/uninstall

docs - General debug
	2 windows
	cgdb examples

docs - Valgrind debug
	2 windows
	install valgrind
	examples

mutt cmdline option to show config search paths?
	probably not worth it

script to build all mutt/neomutt binaries
	one for mutt
	one for neomutt

deprecate muttrc in favour of neomuttrc
	1 Restore all the mutt search dirs
	2 Drop the dated/versioned configs (nobody used them)
	3 Make a release
	4 Start deprecating muttrc (with warnings)
	5 Wait a few releases
	6 Drop muttrc

logging
	print date, then just time for log lines

debug config options
	-O0 -g what else?

add colour to the browser

"wrapmargin" config option needs deprecating like the synonyms

notifications happen when something happens, e.g. new mail
consider a "no longer any more new mail" notification
negative acknowledgements
each notificiation
	would be independent
	could be on or off
user is notified when a notificiation status *changes*

upstream
	s/ascii_str/mutt_str/

lib/file
	separate fcntl and flock into two functions?

travis, relax build errors for upstream
or rename upstream to mutt/upstream

change mutt_unlink to simplify build (O_NOFOLLOW is 2008)
	#ifndef O_NOFOLLOW
	#define O_NOFOLLOW 0
	#endif
safe_fopen too

change safe_rename
	ENOTSUP
	EOPNOTSUPP

sidebar intro -- mention "mailboxes" command

use bsearch to search commands list

merge and drop "scripts" top-level repo

if we delete mutt_md5 from the build, what about windows?
	1) C:\Users\admin>CertUtil -hashfile ping.txt MD5
	2) MD5 hash of file ping.txt:
	3) 4f 75 c2 2c 20 b4 81 54 72 2c a5 7c 95 7a 66 88
	4) CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
we're running a shell script, so we shouldn't worry
if windows, then it must be cygwin

test fcntl and flock on /var/spool/mail/mutt file

remote config option
	user logs in - host, user, password
	first email in inbox (artificially old) contains config
	email is encrypted to yourself (optional)
		need local private key
	ask user: "Apply (verified) remote config?" (optional)
	separate files?
		have an entire folder for config
			magic name - neomutt-config
		alias files
		mailcap
		certificates
		anything but caching files
	have email signed -- easily verified

pgpinvoke doesn't escape the filename of the email to encrypt (last param)
therefore
	set tmpdir = "~/.cache/mutt three"
makes it impossible to send encrypted mail

change build to install to ./install
alter my .gitignore to ignore ./install

:set (list all vars) should depend on the context
(which account/mailbox you have open)
:setlocal (just the account vars)

imap keywords
	work out limitations
	test postpone delete
	expandos with nested threads
	test cases and instructions

need neomutt glossary (search first)

upstream
	more renames
	more deleted files (pgp?)

sort expando switches, comments

aur distro page neo gpg key

tweak doxygen to #define more things for better coverage

ask lists about slang usage
	drop slang

add rfc1847 gpg
add RFC1522
utf-7 -- RFC 1642, superseded by RFC 2152
rfc3986 - URI

listen for tags -- list somewhere public
https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tags.atom

add make tags (to exclude junk)

split the hcache serialisation by struct
	address_serialise
	buffer_serialise
	etc
each struct calls the children it needs
put in some version numbers, or
field type and length bytes before each field

hcache pruner
	use list of mailboxes
	use list of backends (you want)
	won't work for caching files, only folders
		unless we trawl through EVERY email
		might as well cache them too

in pager, which objects are precious/vunerable
	which might be changes outside of the pager

magic -- set *string*, save *int*
	retrieve which?
	or both?

hcache: x [y] z
	y = default

buffer code solaris9(2005!) check

turn STRING, LONGSTRING into numbered consts
	STR1024, etc
	clearer

predefined buffer macros (static)
	=> addstr could fail (out of space)
	easier memory management
	BUFFER256, 1024, etc
	allocate buffer for you & memset it

document meaning of "distros" pages
	min vm install -> build -> debug

are imap vars used outside of imap code?
what about sidebar, browser, etc?
keep their own var lists?  register at startup?

--authors reads file /docs/AUTHORS
--license reads file /docs/LICENSE
if missing, print placeholder URL / GPLv2 respectively
	=> getopt long

now that IMAP, et al, are compiled-in, what's in the docs
	that might be excluded (makedoc conditional)

check management README (missing)

update newbie/hard list from discussions -> focus

check distro installs
	provide list of all installed files/types, etc
	cf each distro

two stage index update?
	hide, refresh
	update
	NO, index vars would still be wrong

ask neou for logo suggestions
	hold competition for art?

use install-sh $(INSTALL) instead of cp

debug_level > n => fflush every line
	or after every 'n' seconds

log before regex ops & other risky functions

parse_set: unset DT_RX doesn't work

Variables
	struct {type, hash, name, union {vars}}
	OPT_INT(Var)
	get_int_opt(name|id)
	type includes "my_"-ness
	who holds the vars?
	get(NULL, name) => default?
	hash inside or out, or both. BOTH
	HASH *vars
	get_name (id)
	get_hash(name)
	get_var(name|id)
	set_var(name|id, var)
	some vars need a validator
	variable sets know their parent
	set variables via a function() -> notifications
	get variables direct from their Var
	variables don't know about refreshing
	where are validators / notifications stored?
		globally (on default config-set)
		per-config-set (allow overrides)
	key my_vars in separate set?

	functions per set, per type
		setter
		getter
		validator
	set by string (from config)
	get by type of user's choice
	internal getters: string, int, bool, void*
	overridden getter returns "Var"?
	then coerced to type?

	hc_init()
		register_type(DT_HCACHE, ops)
	parse_set()
		-> hc_set(string)
		-> hc_validator(string)
	validator per type
	REQUIRE get_str ∀ types

	have separate int/uint variable types?
		which variables need negative values?

	have a 'time' variable type
		allows setting: x=30m (minutes), etc
		may not be worth it, most times are sub-1minute

	strdup? or does the config_set take ownership?

	use high bits of 'type' to save free()/don't free() of a string

	how does 'reset' work?  where is the original value stored?
	do we keep it in the hash elem?
	a "parent" config set of original values?
	how many config values are changed?
	too much overhead?
	hashelems won't be constant
		init var  == address1
		set var   == address2
		set var   == address2
		reset var == address1
	too much overhead?

	how are variables read?
	macro doesn't work if things might be overridden/reset
		can't cache address of HashElem
		unless we have a RESET flag
	hash id may not be unique
	need to work with string representation
	get_bool("sidebar_visible")
	horrendous duplication of strings?

	reset means:
		keep the old value
		or remember who owns the variable

	get/set
		hash = overhead looking up string when USING the variable
		vars = overhead looking up string when setting variables

	notifications to invalidate HashElems?
		too complicated

	caching options could be account-local
		header cache for local mboxes
		body cache too for remote mboxes

	parse_set
		get hashelem
		get id from he
		lookup str_set
		set_set(he, value)

	base types
		bool, num, str, quad
		mutt -D ∀ dump specific
		else str_get

	coercion hc_get_int(he)

	dropping hash means losing the trapping of set-value
		we lose the ability to trigger notifications

	how many variables are going to be account-specific?

	how will +=, -=, *=, /=, ^= work?

	path variable type?  subtype of string?
		flags: FILE, DIR (or both)
		does the setting engine need to know
	mailbox variable type?  subtype of string?
	command variable type?  subtype of string?
		more scrutiny for setting?

	00:00 <cybrNaut> why is "fcc_clear" suggested as a work-around to those without "smime_encrypt_self = yes" in https://www.neomutt.org/feature/encrypt-to-self, when fcc_clear is said to be
			"PGP only" here: https://www.neomutt.org/guide/reference.html#fcc-clear ?
	00:01 <cybrNaut> one of those articles must be wrong
	00:07 <cybrNaut> fcc_clear actually does work for s/mime messages
	00:07 <cybrNaut> so https://www.neomutt.org/guide/reference.html#fcc-clear is wrong

neomutt-test-config.sh
	--save dir
	put mutt's in an output dir
	log each numeric name with the compile options

mutt --authors
	list of all neomutt contributors
	matches {README,AUTHORS}.md
	doesn't have to be in-code!
		could be distributed file
		display in pager

drop support for old SSL versions

cmdline --about links etc

MacOS iTerm
	Ctrl-O doesn't work
	"stty discard undef" fixes it
some other terms too
	rxvt-unicode, openbsd 6.1 - verified
	"stty flush undef" needed

deprecate ChangeLog*
	they're in the git history
	or abbreviate with extreme prejudice

vim-neomutt plugin
	syntax for muttrc
	folding for c

put neomutt-centric mailmaps in management repo

use signal to interrupt IMAP connect
	at time of resume (after suspend)
	systemd service?

Project management:
	contact distros
	organise web updates
	search for patches

change #ifndef's to #warning too
	#ifndef SYMBOL
	#define SYMBOL
	#warning "Please tell neomutt devs about this
	#endif

write REQUIREMENTS doc
	C99
	SUS (Single Unix Specification)
	NotMuch >= 4.3.0
	etc

drop notmuch checks -- assume newer version?

double-width index (continuation of first for wide screens)
	| side | index1 | index2 |

coverity -- some code untested due to config options, e.g. openssl
	need coverage test

use *mutt* to generate sample mailboxes
	create folders
	create emails
	etc

branches in neomutt repo may be eligible for a free rebase
	develop in your own repo, and they may not

create doc repo
	have neomutt repo as a "fixed" git submodule
	or a submodule of a doc-gen repo

macro REGEXEC is only used once

merge muttrc.feature* into one file
	leave markers in that are converted to <a name> anchors
	so we can easily link to sections

ask people how often they'd like to be chased up

doc build requirement on DocBook DTDs

warn on option synonym usage
	{ "pgp_autoencrypt",            DT_SYN,  R_NONE, UL "crypt_autoencrypt", 0 },
	{ "crypt_autoencrypt",  DT_BOOL, R_NONE, OPTCRYPTAUTOENCRYPT, 0 },
	crypt_autoencrypt is the visible option
	warn if pgp_autoencrypt is used

all example muttrcs
	bring them up-to-date (valid options)
	or delete them

2017-03-22 #mutt
	14:43 <wayne47> is there a way to specify a unique SMTP server per mail box?
	14:44 <wayne47> so that when I read mail via imap from foo.com, outgoing mail uses foo.com and when I read from bar.com, outgoing mail uses bar.com (etc)?

configure summary

	Mutt libs:          -lncursesw -ltokyocabinet -lkyotocabinet -lgdbm -lqdbm -ldb-5.3 -llmdb -lidn
what's the distinction?  notmuch and lmdb are both user-specified external deps

web toplevel dir
	/muttrc
	move all samples from the guide
	link guide to samples

configure summary?
	--disable-docs -> docs:         no

"approved" tag? when an idea under discussion gets the go-ahead?
	or just remove the "discussion" tag?

configure.ac broken for conditional features
	--enable-lua
	no libraries

alternative, have coding standard in _std dir
	pieced together by jekyll for both versions

jekyll page type "hidden" -- don't list

topics for my github repos, icons?

sync web & contrib versions of hcache benchmarks
	how?

mutt marks -- are they mailbox-local?
	can we distinguish (like vim) betweeen
	`a  mark in this index
	`A  global mark (potentially in another mailbox)
		is it safe to change mailboxes without warning?
		I suppose macros do this

change "L10N" comments to "TRANSLATORS:"
	(as that's the default)

convert the bug-fixes section of the travis build.sh to work on the upstream branch
	(test all commits, with a small spread of configs)

botty

2017-03-06 #mutt
	17:40 <parosen> "set -o vi" functionality in mutt?

	add a mechanism to expand a mutt variable
	like vim's ^R

useful: extract_url.pl

create muttrc that undoes everything that might be in /etc/Muttrc

	hmm... but it'll be in all branches
	does this make sense?

move the guide to readthedocs.org?

		what about conditional docs?
			how do we only include that which we compile?
			too hard?
			WHICH sections are currently conditional?
	generate man pages from these sources
	strip init.h of its docs
	get default values from "mutt -D" instead

pre-reply hook -- takes original email and formats it however
or
pre-sent hook, filter before send?
why bother?  should be done in editor?

"source" command relative to $cwd or previous file

categorise all messages in code
	info, warning, error, question
which imply user to do: nothing, be informed, worry, query user
errors should be clear whose fault
user: e.g. type something invalid
config: file invalid / missing
code: internal error, missing ops
separate what user cannot do vs MAY not do

debian devs are any platforms NOT using gcc/clang?
	do they have FILE, LINE, FUNC?

can't find mailbox ops error mesage -- coder only compress.c

po multi-fold comment, english, foreign -- why bother?

	zmo suggests: emulate the augroup feature of vim :)
	macros specific to a folder, or notmuch, etc
	have an "account" function that limits to one account

trash folder: forget the directories idea?      who cares about deleted stuff?
trash needs index panel expando -- Original location
archive *needs* dirs %Y / %From?  auto-create, auto-delete on empty
<empty-trash> function
"empty-trash-confirm" variable quad-type
expando for status bar -- trash-size (bytes/Mb) trash-count (number of deleted)
archive needs X-Original-Dir (like del)
	<unarchive> function
tie archive to notmuch to auto index
status bar needs expando for archive contents in (kb,Mb) or (count)
archive/trash expandos -- unless too heavy to calculate
	consult indexes for results/numbers
	does the index store size?
archive needs rich expando save strategy
	%Y, %m, %d -- lots of dates
	%from, %to, etc authors

	size/count of attachments
	every conceivable attribute of original mail

	can mutt-dev-list maintainer get archive from marc.info?

type:investigate ?
	something that needs research
	might lead to docs
	might not lead to code

can I (neomutt) sign the copr key?

mutt -D? (extra options)
	turn output into valid muttrc
	validate muttrc without running
	only display CHANGED values
	only hide SET values
	SORT the options
	add comments from init.h?
	show default values/keybindings

limit-to-tag function?

turn off status bar, like vim laststatus

limit current thread
	new mail shows up even when not in thread

commands
	rename all those containing _ (underscore) to - (hyphen)
	accept either
	autocomplete to hyphen
	linter for muttrc -- with warnings

change release cadence?
	feature release
	bug-fix release
only update translations on bug-fix release
fixes for docs are bug-fixes
two open milestones (next-feature-release, next-bug-fix-release)

donate page
	presents for flatcap?
	contributions to neomutt.org domain?
	get-together costs?
	what?

offline working
	mutt hangs whenever the network goes down and is essentially useless
	what's needed to make mutt useful without a network?
	"auto-postpone"?
	"send-on-reconnect?"
	cache more information about mailboxes?
	network heartbeat to detect connectivity?

magic "combined" folder
	mbox part for unchanging, historic stuff
	mbox part needs hcache for speed
	maildir part of changeable stuff
	combined into one view
	need method to "fix" emails i.e. mark them as no-more-changes

inotify ∀ local mailboxes
	2016-11-16 12:13 <royger>
	flatcap: maybe using some abstraction library, like libfswatch
	(it seems to support kqueue, inotify and fsevents)

How to Use Mutt doc
	step 1 - select your source
		POP, IMAP, local, offlineimap/alternative

Distro pages:
	Debian, Gentoo, MacPorts, NetBSD, Void

	{distro|user} maintained
	{all|limited} features included
	{hcache type}

virtual-mailboxes => notmuch
	=> don't need "notmuch://"
	or even "?query="

imap supports queries
	"+?query=tab:inbox"

named-mailboxes eats two params
	can take multiple pairs of params

un-named-mailboxes needs to work against path or description

man pages need section number

website
	404 is static!
	manual/guide -- not a collection
		needs to be ordered
	src code is not a distro, so list it last

enforce real names in git commits?

rfc add line numbers and 'a' links
	create as a book in main docs (for linking)

look through upstream mutt trac for
	enhancement ideas
	feature patches to apply
	bug fixes
	[easy] ?

use google translate for rough drafts of neo po files?
	mark all translations as fuzzy
	useful starting place?

have a NULL cache which is just a copy of the email
	might *still* need a DB of some info
	tie into offlineimap

named-mailboxes use Mailbox Shortcut % ?
	%tidy-name
	needs plugging into other code
	abbrev names to "%name" if possible
	if configured?

run notmuch new from mutt when new mail arrives
	necessary? or not?

merge notmuch
	"named-mailboxes" command
	can describe sb entry
	how to nest virtual?
	sb obtion: display real, virtual, all mailboxes
	nest -> fake mailboxes
		named-mailboxes name [NOTHING]

neomutt members -- ask preferred method of communication
	pref name @flatcap, Rich

cache files need to hash their name too
	to avoid two systems "sharing" a single hash
	and crashing

nested-if
	stack of nesting chars in char[]
	$? or $< push only
	matching char => pop
	32 deep stack

2016-10-25 11:04 <mgedmin>
	pet peeve: when I try to open a gigabyte-sized mbox file with 10,000 messages, I cannot abort that

2016-10-24 20:54 <flip214>
	it would be very nice if switching to an imap folder could be aborted by ctrl-c
	having all headers fetched anew and having to wait for 2 mins, knowing that the wrong folder is being loaded, isn't that nice
	the counter for the headers fetched (N of M) counts up
	Ctrl-C gets ignored

mutt_launcher
	use a pipe to channel log messages back to mutt
	pipe(), fork()
	dup2() to replace stdout,stderr
		=> printf to log
	stdin -> null

pre-cache app?
workflow:
	offlineimap
	notmuch new
	cache-every-file

code school
	variables
	functions
	architecture 101
	web top-level

need to document "missing" keybindings

	^O terminal (BSD only)
	2016-10-23 22:16 <Riviera> stty discard undef; mutt
	"stty -ixon" disable Ctrl-Q
	can this be done programatically by mutt?
	"stty -a" to show settings
	cfmakeraw(3)

new users -- [ci skip], #123 docs

would notmuch be able to filter out muted conversations?
	No, not unless we change headers and notify notmuch

issues -- always assign (for later reference)
	fixer/mentor only makes sense for bugs/enhancements
	what about questions?

2016-10-21
13:24 <mgedmin> on ubuntu I think it's best to 'sudo apt-get build-dep mutt' to get all the libraries

docs - keep reference copy of all relevant RFCs
	links, obsoletes, etc
	mailcap too

make tags -- ignore standalone tools
	needs to ignore #ifdef TEST, too

external testing
	how many external events can we control?
	how many can we simulate?
	via pretend keystrokes
	key, mouse, winch fs, net

need way to repeatably test net failure
	tcpkill -- doc in dev web

find all non-mail users of pager
	add to index/pager tests

ask new contributors to fill in 5 function prototypes!

does label workflow make sense for PRs?
	if not, why not

new feature checklist -- code all configs, doc, readme, web, doc validate

index preview mode - display 'n' lines of the email body
	when in the index

configure doesn't parse slang option unless ncurses libraries are missing
	check if this is still true
	raised by @nevermind

nested-if -- index-format display ? if doesn't match string put in
	%<> changed to %? !

doc all features' functions doxygen style

move separate tools to a separate tools directory
	adjust ctags to ignore them

bot on server to mail dev list on git commits?

admins need to make a release in 1 week's time -- practice
	(one of them, or all)

distro web pages need install instructions for development, too
	min/max dev packages to build & debug neomutt
	all instructions based on min distro install
	note exact distro instructions were written for

Create every doc idea as empty template page in web
	with notes
	list of docs in project "docs"

htop colour palette only works well because there are
	few object to colour

sidebar -- disable indent, etc if sorted

calcurse -- curses calendar app

"report issue" notes -- OP needs to be around to:
	answer questions
	run tests
	etc

can we workaround the case of gpgme + self sign / smime?
	but use it otherwise?

new mail hook -- frequency limit
	if time < 5s since last notification

function to turn option list from
	(S)ubject to *S*ubject (highlighted/colour)
	make them consistant across mutt
		some are just capital letters

imap/pop ∀ devs
	no outgoing
	incoming to user@dev.neomutt.org
	sample emails refreshed nightly
	btrfs de-duped -- cron
	or cp --reflink

newbie notes
	PR vs branch
	you can't co-work on a PR

issue labels
	confirmed
	need testing
	waiting for OP testing
	have patch

function fuzzer + scripting
	x inputs
	y globals
	difficult because of too many inter-linked structs
	and poorly designed functions

docs - how to transition to neo - list config options
	mutt-only
	neo-additions

website top-level for scripts
	git submodule?
	like irssi scripts

debugging docs:
	100k lines of code
	help us find out which
	bug report blurb

21:55 svenG "No attachments, cancel sending? ([yes]/no):"  so NOT cancelling the sending.. sends. o_O  double negatives are always so confusing.. :-/

de "neo" the trash docs & keep in neo repo

index folding (happens above level of emails)
	fold by option, e.g. day, month
	Wednesday

		mail
	uses extra lines
	saves width

$sort = [prefix-][...]order

filter manager
	time limit option -- on holiday!

forgotten-attachments: German example:

	does it work with \n embedded?
	could I pre-process the email text?
	it it utf-8 compliant?

turn mutt into a random email generator

startup-hook
	immediately before displaying the index for the first time
	useful for testing

(un)new_mail_filter lua [lua...]

new-mail-hook + lua to filter

21:04 <bremner> I too would be interested in a page comparing neomutt's notmuch support with notmuch-mutt (the perl hack that ships with notmuch)

imap_folder_format defaults to folder_format if empty

alternative -- folder_format add
	%local expando for use with nested-if
	conditional display

need separate folder_format for
	local dirs
	net folders
	virtual folders

files/dirs are sorted the same way as network folders
	may not make sense

imap force body cache on read
	option for offline working

mbsync better than offlineimap?

imap only 'n' messages option

www.neomutt.org -> neomutt.org

	exclude the neomutt stargazers

19:32 <mykoserocin> is there a way to show condensed DKIM results instead of full "Authentication-Details" header?
19:32 <mykoserocin> e.g. "DKIM: pass" or "DKIM: fail"
19:52 <brendan> mykoserocin, I use the spam marker system for it: spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=pass" "✓"
19:52 <brendan> spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=fail" "x"

upstream bug -- folder_format, sidebar_format %n (has new mail)
	shouldn't be cleared if "mark_old = no"
	quit and restart mutt and the flag comes back

new index/sidebar_format expando: icons
	each email can have a set of icons
	each icon has a unicode character and a colour
	sorted in order of definition
	tie-in to labels / notmuch tags

2016-08-12
	08:31 <flip214> Hi. Another thing I would love to see: an email arrives in INBOX; I answer it,
		and define the FCC for the sent mail, but the incoming mail is still in INBOX.
		so a "reply-and-move-to-same-folder" would be interesting to me.

2016-08-09
	01:35 <SvenG> but giving a color to "known" addresses (via aliases) would be a killer

doc -> contrib ∀ vimrc, muttrc
	=> will break downstream packaging
	announce change, make change in next release

index-color

	allow unescaped ANSI sequences?
	add offset based pattern, e.g.
		color red default cols:14-20 [mutt pattern]

	create an alias for it '#'
	c# -> change to alternate directory
		new alternate becomes old dir
	save files to #
	set alternate mailbox function
	colour highlight for alternate mailbox
	expando %# for alternate displays '#' or ''

mutt tips on startup
	distribute a contrib/mutt-tips dir which is a mailbox
	select a random (email/tip) from the list
	pick one that's unread (preferably)
	how can we preserve the "read-ness" of an email after a package update?
	.mutt.top-tips ? -- save a list of message-ids in there?
	<top-tips> command creates a new mailbox (from DATA_DIR/DOC_DIR)
		if in /usr it would be read-only
		need to store flags elsewhere
		flags: read, flagged!, deleted (i.e. don't show me again)
	intersperse with mailboxes commands
	tips should be self-contained (to start with)
		unless they reference old tips
		nested emails?  what about multiple inheritance?
		need hyperlinking "see also" links
	use labels (from Keywords plugin) to add value
	use mutt's caching facility to store the metadata

sidebar
	option to fold nested mailboxes
	option to unfold when new mail arrives
	folded, they should show the cumulative totals for all the children

	(disabled)
	what other defaults?

update-from-hg.sh
	-n option => no push to github

firstb <REGEX>
	regex if it contains a '*'
	anchored at bol?
	multiple args => not regex

macro instruction <no-history> like vim's <silent>
	some macros end up in the log

'ifdef' improvement
	ability to check mutt version number
	ifdef VERSION == X
	ifdef VERSION > Y
	like vim

new-mail => dbus as a goal, see dgc

	memset to ' ', null at width, addstr()

add tutorials (like sidebar intro) to the website
	redlink some empty ones (or partials)
	ask for translations?

use Gutenberg texts for sample emails
	use mutt-dev mailing list as a template?
	alias all names
	replace all message-ids (but keep links)
	strip out most headers

neo-stats.pl
	ignore issues tagged 'release'
	ignore integration issues?
	or count only 'bugs' and unlabelled

	functions => components (e.g. mail)     }- mail_init() register_functions(); register_commands();
	commands => components                  }

mirror script, add copr, aur repos
show focus -- sacrifice help line?
	no, it's not always visible
propagation of notifications -- start @focus, work down
	SB, IW, PW + 'q' mail accepts, hides PW, PS, focus IW
	SB, IW + 'q' mail notified, rejects, global accepts, closes app
Help starts @focus, Panel Name + get_keys method
if sidebar is a separate panel and src file, should IW be?  PW?  AI?
If focus is on PW and SB, IW, PW are siblings, how can SB get notifications?
	or does mail Panel catch and iterate through children?
	SB mappings are (index,pager) => behaviour wanted but not in AW

panels have dividers enum
	left
	right
	top
	bottom
	between
	outside
who owns the dividers space?
set_focus (panel)
	who owns the focus?
	gfx(curses)?
	get_char -> gfx_get_char -> consider focus
on close panel, focus moves to
	*prev*/next sibling, or parent?
	due to mutt's UI focus moves to prev sibling
how can I show focus without moving anything? i.e. borders
	sacrifice a top line?
	border highlight?  => always present
which panels *accept* focus?
	sidebar
	index window
	pager window
	<tab> to switch?
	or <left>, <right>?

<sidebar-next-new> => $sidebar_flagged_are_new ?

website: some bug-fixes have gone away -> success page?
set/unset sidebar_visible doesn't refresh screen when in pager
sb doesn't match folder (for open) if it has a trailing /

∀ new bugfixes -- reference trac number in commit message

kdave - limit-current-thread
	alt-l (show limit) should respond "limit thread"
	is "limit ." the same as "limit all" -- YES
		fixed internally
	create unlimit patch and pull-request for kdave?
	limit doesn't have any context, just a pattern
	limit-current-thread NEEDS to know current email
	it'd be nice to change limit to accept another "string" arg
	currently
		"all" -> "~A"
	change limit
		"thread" -> "~a" (only letter available)
		let general limit machinery do the work
	unfortunately they can't see the current email

rewrite mutt_wstr_trunc()
	first, rename variables to be something sensible
	second, refactor to be legible

vim library of config options(vars)
	auto-extract from init.h

kill version.c:rstrip_in_place()
	fix external build scripts

what does Sidebar *really* need?
	Incoming BUFFY -> notifications of BUFFY changes
	Panel (geometry) -> notifications of WINCH
	character libraries -> lengths, widths, formatting, etc
	options (config access)
	colours
	curses: clear(panel), clear(line), write (char/string), move(x,y)
		curses calls are all (0,0)-based
		curses takes panel object and converts to screen coordinates
		∀ users
	callbacks for functions
	sb is initialised with (Panel pointer), notifications on change
	can query Panel's size, position (not useful), visibility
	panel can be visible, but !active, e.g. partially under a modal dialog
		=> paint if asked, but won't receive keys
		could still be asked to do stuff by dialog, etc

how about modal dialogs?
	1 dialog could invalidate sidebar, index, pager
	sibling to sidebar, index, pager but last in list (z-order)
	sb, index, panel get painted, then "floating" window gets painted over
	modal => disable key mappings/propagation

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside area of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

attach sets of keybindings to panel hierarchy?
modify docs generation to process commands' comments
can some keybindings be set "only active when window is visible"?
	=> help doesn't (necessarily) hide sidebar
		should sidebar keys work?  probably not
	*should* help hide the sidebar?
		probably yes

sidebar indented folders
	fill in gaps in hierarchy automatically
	make them non-selectable (unless the user has "mailboxes" them)
	alternatively, have some way to mark mailboxes as "fake"
		probably a horrible idea

separate draw() in sidebar for
	emails
	notmuch
	nntp
	addressbook?

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

manual "variables" need description field

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

cond-date needs some concrete examples

change docs to use <example>

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

docs refer to alias menu but don't mention how to invoke it
browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

use sort_aux for nested sidebar names?
	no, sub-folders are same type?
		no
	YES: allows to sort by name, then subsort by new-count
	separate variable otherwise it interferes with index, etc

community script check for update
	date community docs?
	or just rely on commit date?

git hook variables
	prepare-commit-msg
	GIT_DIR
	GIT_WORK_TREE
	GIT_INDEX_FILE
	GIT_PREFIX
	GITHEAD_XXX

auto-generate merge commit messages
	modified git log msg
	script for authors
	commented out - but accessible?

replace " with ' in muttrc

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

docs/muttrc/readme/init.h
	need to document default values for variables

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

git
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar

break up and rewrite mutt docs
	break into smaller sections
	separate mutt-doc repo
	translate sections (default to english if missing)

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

cache sidebar formatted strings on BUFFY object?

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares
	gperf to generate perfect hashes

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

keep revision number for all config items (as a prelude to proper notifications)
	only increment revision number on change
	leads to possible A-B-A problem (change blindness)
	if (ver(format_str) > old_ver) STMT;
	allows code to make informed decisions about caching

which config items require frequent and costly interpretation?
	all format strings -- every line, every refresh

data source LDAP

	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

Alternate views in the sidebar
	need toggle function
	imap: folders  <--> dir tree
	local: folders <--> dir browser

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistant undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

integrate nntp into sidebar
what does notmuch return?
	how do i link it to existing objects?

sb extra colours for:
	readonly mailboxes
		expando?
	bad (non-existent) mailboxes
		expando?
	virtual mailboxes
	what other attrs?
	colour by SRC
	separate colour schemes by SRC?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate BUFFYs
sidebar needs NO-selection possibility for toggle-virtual
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

notmuch
	add new virtual folders to sidebar
		automatically?
	what name should it be given?
		automatic?
			allow user rename?
		ask user?
	how can we make them persistant?

sb expandos
	compare letters to status_format letters
	deleted?
	number after limiting
	unread?

postpone patch doesn't quite work
	1) The PostContext and menu are private, so sidebar can't tell that
	   we're looking at the postponed list after navigation.
	2) After navigating to another folder, you still have to "quit" to
	   get the display to refresh.

alternative to lightweight patch
	don't update info ∀ BUFFYs
	just update the current page
	only update lists when the user OPENs a folder
	not when they move the highlight
	could pre-emptively populate the previous/next pages

sidebar expandos
	%c number of non-deleted emails (total - deleted)
	%s = %c? (lower case version of %S?)

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
break up init.h, globals.h, functions.h
	init.h option DELEGATE, prefix "sidebar_", callback?
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, buffy.c, mh.c
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
separate modules -- sidebar, index, pager, help? -- each with
	init()
	notify()
	close()
	config()
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

can the real status bar display any sidebar fields?
	why not?
	how can they be integrated?

Unmailbox * ⇒  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

tree chars for sidebar hierarchy?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Start; Incoming; Inbox open; current = Incoming; sort → cur is offscreen, boundaries lost

draw sidebar
	assumes position/size
	move due to STATUSONTOP, HELP
	check of show/hidden has changed & refresh numbers if nec
	if hidden, do nothing
	sanity check settings
	draw divider (3 chars!)
for all buffers
	set colour
	move
	gen displayname (need to cache this)
		name, bytelen, screenlen
		what about config changes
			including sort order
	make sidebar_entry
fill remaining lines with blanks

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Sidebar actions (that might precipitate change):
	line-up
	line-down
	page-up
	page-down
	set buffy from browser
	change sort order
	add mailbox
	delete mailbox
	change mailbox's sort criteria (e.g. flag an email, a flagged-sorted mailbox)
	resize window
	hide sidebar
	show sidebar
	open folder

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Notify (Box*, Rect old, Rect new, flags)
Flags:
	too small to render
	changed visibility

Changed posn notification ONLY
	e.g. sidebar has swapped sides
could imply that cached data may be OK to reuse
	e.g. don't need to call calc_boundaries

repaint if:
	size changes
	position changes

DBUS plugin -- to do what?
	notify out
	take input to do what?
		accept mailto: links

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

quiet config option -- don't whine about unknown config options
	or quiet command line option

sb_draw should return success of drawing
	possible given all the callbacks, etc?

trim trailing slash from mailboxes, folder
	shouldn't be displayed

New only -- include structure (empty dirs) to keep hierarchy
	mail (0)
	  fruit (0)
	    apple (1)

sorting
	if displaying full paths:
		sort by display name
		sort by underlying name
	if displaying indented paths:
		sort by top-level names, then children

sidebar_width = auto (size to contents)
	would need to parse and format all strings ahead of drawing divider

possible to fix sidebar sort order to respect hierarchy/indentation?

need attention
	draw_sidebar
	OPTSIDEBARSORT
		sorts by real path, not visible name

sidebar_dividers
	first (wide) character is vertical divider
		between sidebar and index/pager
	second (wide) character is horizontal divider
		between different mailboxes (within the sidebar)

send escape sequence to clear terminal title when mutt closes
init.h struct option_t needs enums for types and union for data
timer notifications, e.g.
	highlight something for three seconds, then return to normal
https://github.com/N8Fear/mutt-kz
	some initialisations improvements
	some bug fixes

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

wrapping →
	extra char at beginning of line "+"
	extra char at end of line "<-/"
wrap at:
	char
	word (whitespace)
	clause (punctuation)
	sentence (.!?)
No wrap →
	extra char at end of line ">"

Window changes
	hidden  no params
	visible rect
	resize  rect
