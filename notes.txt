on completion of H,M tasks praise on dev-ml

fix mnemosyne 0-index bug

private repo for mail-aliases and dot-mutt repo

'Folder' limits the independence of mailbox.c
	limited to parse_mailboxes()?

after release
	priority to bug-fixes, tidying
	after that, help2, contrib (e.g. colourschemes)
	so that others can help us

path_canon
	check that Folder, LastFolder, etc exist before using them

merge mailbox.c and mx.c?
	now that there aren't any deps
	may need to move parse_(un)mailboxes out

update wiki for new hard/medium/easy, update roadmap

:verbose set/color/etc
	show when/who last set that variable/color/etc

RE-opening mailbox
	postpone, trash, edit msg, send message (fcc ^)
	all suffer from dead mailbox ptr

BUG: tag-prefix doesn't work with # (break-thread)

Issue template for DEV release
	version (commit hash)
	backtrace
	actions

data type INTERVAL, numeric
	accepts 1s (sec), 1h (hour), etc
	displayed as?:
		1h
		3600
		3600 # 1 hour

mx_mbox_open -- force type?
	arg 0 => probe
	'n' == MBOX, etc

split up opcodes by action and detail (sub-action)
	18:03 <adray> You know how we define virtual-mailboxes as "MUTT_VIRTUAL | MUTT_NAMED". Would it be possible to do the same for opcodes? So instead 
		of OP_MAIN_VFOLDER_FROM_QUERY_READONLY, it could be OP_MAIN_VFOLDER_FROM_QUERY | OP_READONLY?
	18:04 <adray> (this also ties into your OP_DELETE code, possible to do OP_ATTACHMENT | OP_DELETE)
	18:06 <flatcap> currently, they're an enumeration
	18:07 <flatcap> I wonder how many combinations would make sense.  how many we'd need to make it pay off
	18:10 <flatcap> hmm... quite a few
	18:10 <flatcap> all the SEARCH_X could become SEARCH | X

format strings
	valid when set
	easy task?

format strings: compose_format, pager_format, status_format
	when empty DON'T display the bar at all
	easy task?

format strings have a list of
	[ callback_fn, data ]
	use this to split up deps
	GUI could have [ X, ctx ]
	reducing deps of mutt_expando_format()

logging - extend 2 second rule by logging level
	l2 message overwrites a l3 message
	l3 message is blocked a l2 message

icommand swap back (err -> -2)
	MUTT_CMD_ERROR   = -1,
	MUTT_CMD_WARNING = -2,
	need to check/fix all callers

use help bar for menu breadcrumbs
	compose, attach email, view attachment
	stacked menus

have lambda function to add Emails to an EmailList
	bool is_tagged(Email);

help log level
	for each mutt_error/warning
	also log a link to the relevant help page
	maybe not visible on screen (one line)
	and not logged, but visible in <show-log-messages> window

context
	maildir_update_tables no longer used

∀ oldx = x; fn(); x = oldx;
	parameterise (x) (e.g. Sort)
	i.e. find functions using global/config variables

objects must have X_new()/X_free() pair, or neither
	check existing
	51 X_new()
	55 X_free()
	148 struct
	292 [cm]alloc
	find/distinguish between
		struct - simple, data
		object - complex, actions
	data still needs free for ptrs
	too simplistic?

repo for colour schemes
	min requirements?
	light/dark versions?
	cf vim set background=light
	installed scheme directory
	'colorscheme' command to activate

mbox_type can only be a *local* mailbox type
	need a validator

reduce contributors to 6 months?
split authors at 6 months? and 'others'
	split at 3 months?
	call recent *active* developers
	change at release time

we have A-specific config
	A-specific commands and hooks too?

command to switch account - multi-selection list?  menu?

change pager for <show-log-messages> to start at end of file

docs: printing, 3 examples
	off: bind p to nop
	ldr: normal printing setup
	pdf: 'print' to pdf file

nntp
	nntp:// or news:// ?

.desktop for nntp:// -> neomutt

factor out the code for command "mailboxes"
	so that imap/nntp don't have to create a string
	"mailboxes QUOTED-NAME" just to have it parsed and de-quoted

define?
	STR_MAILBOX (PATH_MAX sized)
	STR_COMMAND (BIG)

check the contents of NONULL for expensive calls
	#define NONULL(x) (x ? x : "")
	'x' evaluated twice

create synonym <move-message> for <save-message>?

is smtp a BE?
	write-only mailbox
	auth, connection
	definitely need an smtp *dir* and tidier API for sending
	encapsulate vars in dir

multiple notifications
	one on each M that's changed
	plus, one on A -> STATS_CHANGED
	one on N, too?  ACTIVITY?

help mailbox
	option to autoopen all images?
	or cursor right on link
	when composing help update, add header with filename, commit hash if poss

reddit mailbox backend?
	see rtv project (python, curses)

rename storage globals to match the neomutt commands, e.g.
	UserHeader -> MyHdr
	or GlobalListMyHdr?

does tree layout of M -> a dummy root M? ∀ BE? probably
	is "/" the root?
	is "INBOX" the root?
	where does "INBOX" live?
users won't want M under INBOX

sileht/imap LONGSTRING -> PATH_MAX * 7
	comments for MData

use travis on [master] to update/deploy to gitlab?

rule for BE only new M iff A and MData AND AData full set

Broken?
	FCC + $record = ^

deprecate imap_logout_all
	create <logout>, tie into mxapi
	or <close-mailbox> for imap/nntp
	forcibly break connection
	free resources?

get 'build' script to log commit hash
	simplify "git build"

pop: add "neomutt -z" support?

histignore M and other uppers

timeout hook ∀ BE?

ctrl-C ∀ BE ∀ mxapi functions

mutt_log(Buffer) -> split at \n
	multiple logs
	what level (all at same?)

pattern ~w (newsgroup) not doc'd

how does reply_regex fit into index and replying?

maintain stable numbering in the index
	(mailx does this)
	each email is given a sequential number
	new emails get a higher number
	deleted emails' numbers aren't reused
	what happens if the list is resorted?
		numbers end up randomised!
	what about patterns for message numbers
		ignore missing?
		what about -5,.
		find 5 messages, regardless of number?

docs:
	generate gv for build of website
	which files are generated, how, src
	which files are imported: code, etc
	which files are canonical

connect to server using openssl
	openssl s_client -connect 10.8.0.1:993
	then use imap commands
	a1 login USERNAME PASSWORD

login problems: help
	try imap://username@imap.provider.com
	try imap://username@provider.com@imap.provider.com

prevent too-long regexes causing 100% cpu
	- color body magenta default "(ftp|http|https)://[^ ]+"
	+ color body magenta default "(ftp|http|https)://[^ ]{,1024}"
	also
	- color body magenta default [-a-z_0-9.\+]+@[-a-z_0-9.]+
	+ color body magenta default [-a-z_0-9.\+]{,128}@[-a-z_0-9.]{,128}

git pr improvements
	config item for upstream (github)
	'refresh' command, if possible to fast-forward
		--force hard reset
	'clean' command if unchanged
		--force lose changes
	stop it pulling tags
	config item for name template, e.g. "pr/%s"
		or --name X (or --name pr%s)
	pr list -- can't tell if they're open

eliminate #ifdef USE_HCACHE for
	int mh_sync_mailbox_message(struct Context *ctx, int msgno, header_cache_t *hc);
	void * typedef if not def'd

some MxOps are compulsory, some are always implemented
	drop checks for these?
	what about if (adata) assume free_adata() exists?

eliminate AllMailboxes
	start with fn  ML = get_mailboxes(FLAT|TREE);
	HIDDEN|VISIBLE

sidebar option to toggle subscribed folders
	=> keep all unsub'd folders
	what about nntp -> 32K on gmane

"subscribe-to" command for imap undoc'd (and "unsubscribe-to")

fedora build docs
	missing for `--everything` build
	lua-devel, db-devel, gdbm-devel, qdbm-devel, make, libidn2-devel
	ctags, w3m, doxygen, ccache

l - limit by notmuch or have notmuch pattern

sidebar intro 'support +sidebar'!

try alternate imap folder separators, e.g. | :
sizeof(Mailbox) = 8392
	2*4K (paths) + 200 bytes

browser
	changing sort doesn't force redraw

browser - why are delete, rename and create folder limited to IMAP?
	maildir, mbox should work too
	mxapi?

trap more signals?
	cleanup files (not the partial emails) on exit
	e.g. attachments

Quoting
	list of special items: $var, $VAR, \n, etc
	have flags for each
	literal backslash \\
	behaviour of each unquoted, and each single quote type
	then all pairs: '"X"' or "'X'", etc
	single, double, backtick
		'X', "X", `X`
		'"X"', '`X`', "'X'", "`X`", `'X'`, `"X"`
	triple?  a lot of processing
	what about unicode curly quotes?

flags typedef - call it BitField16?
hcache move conditionals to end of struct?
no pattern to search by label (or regex)
doc pattern ~Y missing
rename notmuch files to nm_, lose mutt_ too
when checking for new mail, distinguish local from remote (cheap from costly)?
attach style sheet to email - mutt color commands - email-specific

on segfault, log backtrace to logfile too

sidebar abbreviation option
	/apple/banana/cherry/folder becomes
	/a/b/c/folder

announce <named-mailboxes> on dev ml

mailbox->[real]path -> ptr !array

typedef for flags: unsigned type
	u{8,16,32}, FLAGS{8,16,32}

imap A has Config:
	"user" inherited from "imap_user"
	"imap_user" synonym for "A:user"
∀ imap config, setup synonyms without "imap_" ?
	what does dump display?  tidy version or canonical?

validators interfere with doc gen (manual.xml)

revamp format string expandos (2018-10-12)
	<darnir> But on a more serious note, how about printf style format strings, with modifiers?
	<flatcap> they already accept %4.4s type modifiers, so it's a bit tricky to fit anything else in
	<flatcap> the alternative is to steal back %{} and have %{name} -- it gets a bit verbose, but it's much clearer
	<darnir> I like that
	<darnir> It's a config file. I never mind things that are verbose in there
	<flatcap> it might be possible to transition without causing trouble...
	<flatcap> %{} is a date specifier, but if we check the contents for our magic words first
	<darnir> With the verbose %{} ones. Yeah, that should be doable.
	<darnir> I have a suggestion, but it depends on how willing you are to deprecate old syntax
	<darnir> %{option-name:optional fmt string}
	<darnir> And in a year or so, make the %{fmt} syntax disappear
	<flatcap> so %{desc:.40} description limited to 40 chars
	<flatcap> I like the self-contained-ness of it
	<darnir> I like that as well

deprecated config - default value is help string
	what about synonyms that will be deprecated?  same?  yes (ish)

restricted "source" command - after reading/applying colours
	have a "keep these colours" question
	default to "No", with a *timeout*

index_format expandos for "Waiting for info"? hourglass?
IMAP use different TAG (a0001) ∀ A, a0, b0, etc
libmx - no curses - what would be in it?
config: set tests missing \ -- am *I* mistaken about need?  unnec?

define config *functions* - named config scripts
	perhaps named f-USERSPEC -> bind <f-userspec>

logging - take a Buffer param

odd code:
	using strfcpy to write to a struct Buffer
	over 20 occurrences in color.c, config/dump.c, curs_main.c, hook.c, init.c, keymap.c, mailbox.c, mutt_lua.c, pattern.c, score.c
	mutt_str_strfcpy(err->data, _("current mailbox shortcut '^' is unset"), err->dsize);
	grep "strfcpy.*->data"
	might require buffer_reset() first

custom help bar text, like vim's tab bar, status bar -> lua?

option for folder auto-discovery
	<mailboxes> everything server has
	or all dirs and subdirs
	make that the default behaviour?
	unless <mailboxes> performed or check_subscribed set

custom-tags example
	bind index,pager tt "<modify-labels>!todo\n" "Toggle the 'todo' tag"
	should use macro

new repos:
	disable issues
	protect master
	add readme
	add license
	archive

unify naming of conn_*() sock_*() functions

nm queries
	?name=XYZ
	?desc=XYZ
		for a named query
	?subscribe[=yes]
	?persistent[=yes]
		for session-permanence?
	equivalent to "mailboxes ^"
	are options needed?  useful?

nntp allow bare host urls
	nntp://news.host.com  (no trailing slash)

M - messages menu
	show name of debug file in status bar

create 'let' command for maths?
	like set for numeric
	confusing?  probably?

index_sort = date,thread:rev-date?

compress
	does it really need: `bool locked`
	or is the `FILE*` enough?

<thread-SCOPE>ACTION like ;d (tag-delete)
	<thread-latest><display-message>
	<thread-first-new><display-message>
	only for threaded & collapsed

convert compress to use ACL ... can DELETE?

fake typedef for qsort functions?
	already have sort_t -- qsort compatible?

what would be needed to have an 'offline' mode?
	how much extra folder info would we need?
	just keep one copy of the 'last state'
	how much code would need rearranging?

maildir:
	readdir()
	set errno to 0 first
	check after and perror if nec

check [release]
	config check
	one of regexes is missing '\' before a '+'

help://
	add doxy pages

twitter "Re:" -> default config?

users
	set flp=^\\(Cc\\\|To\\\|From\\\|Bcc\\\|Subject\\\|Reply-To\\):
	extend to all common headers
	include vim's default settings
	need to set 'ai'
	formatoptions needs 'n'

create a coding 'charter'
	what's expected
		from you
		from us

c++ build fix reserved names

fix travis build

should the current folder show up in the sidebar
	even if it's not mailboxes'd?
	nice!
	then disappear when de-selected?
	allow the user to 'subscribe' to it to keep it
	allow the user to 'unsubscribe' from any folder
		temporarily gone (till end of the session)
	should this be:
		<sidebar-subscribe>
		<sidebar-unsubscribe>
	or
		<subscribe-folder>
		<unsubscribe-folder>

easy: locale.c
	needs to be free of <intl.h>
	4 places: setlocale to C and call strftime()
	4 places: setlocale to C and call mutt_make_string() which has date/time components
	main.c has setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
	Some strange code in ncrypt/crypt_gpgme.c
	wrap up all but gpgme

easy
	strncpy -> strfcpy
	docker for dovecot
	stailq smimekey
	stailq pgpkey
	muttindexwindow workaround
	refactor mbox_path_probe (does fgetc, then fread)

change path_probe to return enum
	inc ERROR codes
	check callers check for error

mutt_bits_* functions use array of unsigned char
	unnecessary, nobody uses more that 16 bits
	just use unsigned int and simplify the macros

status/pager format
	if empty don't display?
	will need a dividing line between index and pager
	collapse the status bar and command line?
	what about error messages?  timed?

option to mailcap-view objects from the browser (on attach)

Display help mailbox is no others are 'mailboxes'd

Easy: postpone question to three-way
	(S)ave, (D)elete, (C)ancel

Disable some default keybindings?
	e.g. <print>, mailing list functions
	or have sample config rc snippets
	or change to more key-chords
		tag-X, tag-Y, tag-Z
	become
		tx, ty, tz
	snippets in /etc/neomutt/*.rc?
	/usr/share/neomutt/snippets/

have a 'theme' command for use in restricted situations, like
	neomutt-tutor

BUG: message says 'purge' but actually deletes (to trash)
	$trash set, 'd' Delete, vs 'D' purge
	then leave folder to commit

UI
	In messages/errors rather than quoting filenames
	bright/bold them -- how?
	custom printf-specifier?
	mutt_message("can't read %Fs");
	mutt_message inserts the colour codes if required

Most translation messages that are questions (to prompt the user)
	have trailing whitespace -- nuisance for the translator
	kill them, adjust code

browser
	need clearer feedback *what* we're looking at
	IMAP mailboxes, IMAP directory, local directory
	and clearer ways to swap between the choices

megabuild
	combine "git build" and parallel
	use git commit range + clist
	nested build dirs

smime_timeout missing LNUM

magic "alias" mailbox stored on server
	multiple emails
	subject determines how it's processed
	signed for safety

sidebar
	colours using patterns? ~N ~F
	colours for spool, trash, postpone?

intptr_t vs long in config
	shrink DT_LONG

if user's sendmail fails, notify the user

jekyll/github pages howto
	clone website
	gem install
	jekyll + jekyll-X plugins
	bundler
	or disable plugins in _config.yml
	j-mentions?
	gem install github-pages
	(all deps needed)
	put in a docker (search first)

difference between Body and Attachment
	which members are used for which?

hcache namer
	split (root, dir, name) triplet?

html email
	I use this: text/html; elinks -dump 1 -config-dir ~/.mutt/ %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput
	with this elinks.conf http://thorsten-wissmann.de/p/6207785e4784977712fc213a687ad033
	with this, the urls are footnotes at the end and so the rarely wrap

man neomutt should tell a beginner everything they need to know
	or where to look for more

flags variables/members -> unsigned
	every member commented with sample flag name

separate parsing from pre-processing step
	standard library routines to parse
		list the quoting characters
		flags for escaping, etc
	custom bits to perform shell stuff?

have a system for 'tainting' variables
	the sensitive variables are tainted
	if I 'set my_var = $imap_pass' then my_var is tainted too
	tainted variables will not
		be displayed on screen
		exported/expanded for extenal programs (including lua)

rename members
	bools to is_x, has_x, etc
	amounts to num_x, nr_x, etc

expand reviewers to all frequent committers?

put docs for [travis], [release], [translate] into original commit message
	add README.md to [management] for each

add lua test to release
	neomutt -B -F contrib/lua/test_lua-api_runner.neomuttrc

(neo)mutt can't read maildir emails
	it'd be useful to:
	neomutt -f maildir/cur/email:2,S

use neomutt as a viewer/pager for emails
	like less(1)
	would require a crazy amount of code changes

remove umask code from mh.c
	redundant due to `umask(077)` in main.c

all global variables should be set using the config mechanism

how do we test the static functions in the libraries?
	make *everything* public?

if not, they must be completely robust

up-to-date list of functions/data for each library, split into:
	public functions/data
	static functions/data
one (background?) colour for each library
one shared colour for ALL static functions
use ctags to generate lists

create a literal string marker:
	set x = /Don't "shoot"?/
or something like vim's unmagic \V

kill ISSPACE macro -- no benefit to having it
	what about the (unsigned char*) cast in it?

	2 Drop the dated/versioned configs (nobody used them)
	3 Make a release
	4 Start deprecating muttrc (with warnings)
	5 Wait a few releases
	6 Drop muttrc

"wrapmargin" config option needs deprecating like the synonyms

notifications happen when something happens, e.g. new mail

	it would be very nice if switching to an imap folder could be aborted by ctrl-c
	having all headers fetched anew and having to wait for 2 mins, knowing that the wrong folder is being loaded, isn't that nice
	the counter for the headers fetched (N of M) counts up
	Ctrl-C gets ignored

	fixer/mentor only makes sense for bugs/enhancements
	what about questions?

2016-10-21
13:24 <mgedmin> on ubuntu I think it's best to 'sudo apt-get build-dep mutt' to get all the libraries

docs - keep reference copy of all relevant RFCs
	links, obsoletes, etc
	mailcap too

make tags -- ignore standalone tools
	needs to ignore #ifdef TEST, too

external testing
	how many external events can we control?
	how many can we simulate?
	via pretend keystrokes
	key, mouse, winch fs, net

need way to repeatably test net failure
	tcpkill -- doc in dev web

Create every doc idea as empty template page in web
	with notes
	list of docs in project "docs"

htop colour palette only works well because there are

newbie notes
	PR vs branch
	you can't co-work on a PR

function fuzzer + scripting
	x inputs
	y globals
	difficult because of too many inter-linked structs
	and poorly designed functions

website top-level for scripts
	git submodule?
	like irssi scripts

debugging docs:
	100k lines of code
	help us find out which
	bug report blurb

21:55 svenG "No attachments, cancel sending? ([yes]/no):"  so NOT cancelling the sending.. sends. o_O  double negatives are always so confusing.. :-/

de "neo" the trash docs & keep in neo repo

index folding (happens above level of emails)
	fold by option, e.g. day, month
	Wednesday

		mail
	July
		mail
		mail
	uses extra lines
	saves width

$sort = [prefix-][...]order

	does it work with \n embedded?
	could I pre-process the email text?
	it it utf-8 compliant?

turn mutt into a random email generator

startup-hook
	immediately before displaying the index for the first time
	useful for testing
shutdown-hook
	before closing mailbox connections

(un)new_mail_filter lua [lua...]

new-mail-hook + lua to filter

need separate folder_format for
	local dirs
	net folders
	virtual folders

files/dirs are sorted the same way as network folders
	may not make sense

imap force body cache on read
	option for offline working

mbsync better than offlineimap?

imap only 'n' messages option

modularise header caching/dbs
	=> needn't use same cache type
	for header / message cache

pager -- sidebar gets updated but not status line / term header

vim-like hls option: persistant across emails

source script|
	pipe -- lookup exact meaning and implications
	works, but can't tell you where an error occurred

context sensitive popup menus
	e.g. index - tag some emails, hit <menu>
	options: copy, save, delete, set flags, reply, etc

check all lists of features are up-to-date
	web, etc

19:32 <mykoserocin> is there a way to show condensed DKIM results instead of full "Authentication-Details" header?
19:32 <mykoserocin> e.g. "DKIM: pass" or "DKIM: fail"
19:52 <brendan> mykoserocin, I use the spam marker system for it: spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=pass" "✓"

	common docs, travis

sidebar -- imap all folders vs subscribed
dovecot public mailboxes for tips?  one public user?
nntp tips? ":tips" command to toggle nntp vars and mailboxes

remote config -- like browser proxy setup
	display to user "are you sure?"
	useful for tips & examples
	way too dangerous

notmuch+index-color
	tag patches in *neomutt*

2016-08-12
	08:31 <flip214> Hi. Another thing I would love to see: an email arrives in INBOX; I answer it,
		and define the FCC for the sent mail, but the incoming mail is still in INBOX.
		so a "reply-and-move-to-same-folder" would be interesting to me.

doc -> contrib ∀ vimrc, muttrc
	=> will break downstream packaging
	announce change, make change in next release

index-color
	patterns on date
	allow unescaped ANSI sequences?
	add offset based pattern, e.g.
		color red default cols:14-20 [mutt pattern]

transition guide:
	man neomutt
	a guide for users of mutt moving to neomutt

symlink man pages, etc (for ease of use)
	neomutt -> mutt

sidebar
	separate colour for read-only mailbox
	expando for read-only mailbox

sidebar
	have an alternate mailbox like vim's alternate file
	(isn't this the '-' mailbox?)
	create an alias for it '#'
	c# -> change to alternate directory
		new alternate becomes old dir
	save files to #
	set alternate mailbox function
	colour highlight for alternate mailbox
	expando %# for alternate displays '#' or ''

mutt tips on startup
	distribute a contrib/mutt-tips dir which is a mailbox
	select a random (email/tip) from the list
	pick one that's unread (preferably)
	how can we preserve the "read-ness" of an email after a package update?
	.mutt.top-tips ? -- save a list of message-ids in there?
	<top-tips> command creates a new mailbox (from DATA_DIR/DOC_DIR)
		if in /usr it would be read-only
		need to store flags elsewhere
		flags: read, flagged!, deleted (i.e. don't show me again)
	intersperse with mailboxes commands
	tips should be self-contained (to start with)
		unless they reference old tips
		nested emails?  what about multiple inheritance?
		need hyperlinking "see also" links
	use labels (from Keywords plugin) to add value
	use mutt's caching facility to store the metadata

sidebar
	option to fold nested mailboxes
	option to unfold when new mail arrives
	folded, they should show the cumulative totals for all the children

git b(){} needs to disable colour on piping

git clone
	always pull in my prepare-commit-msg hook
	(disabled)
	what other defaults?

firstb <REGEX>
	regex if it contains a '*'
	anchored at bol?

macro instruction <no-history> like vim's <silent>
	some macros end up in the log

	memset to ' ', null at width, addstr()

add tutorials (like sidebar intro) to the website
	redlink some empty ones (or partials)
	ask for translations?

use Gutenberg texts for sample emails

	alias all names
	replace all message-ids (but keep links)
	strip out most headers

neo-stats.pl
	ignore issues tagged 'release'

sample mail repo filled with example/problem mailboxes

delegation of keys -> focus() -> parent -> global, e.g. IW, Mail
	functions => components (e.g. mail)     }- mail_init() register_functions(); register_commands();
	commands => components                  }

mirror script, add copr, aur repos
show focus -- sacrifice help line?
	no, it's not always visible
propagation of notifications -- start @focus, work down
	SB, IW, PW + 'q' mail accepts, hides PW, PS, focus IW
	SB, IW + 'q' mail notified, rejects, global accepts, closes app
Help starts @focus, Panel Name + get_keys method
if sidebar is a separate panel and src file, should IW be?  PW?  AI?
If focus is on PW and SB, IW, PW are siblings, how can SB get notifications?
	or does mail Panel catch and iterate through children?
	SB mappings are (index,pager) => behaviour wanted but not in AW

panels have dividers enum
	left
	right
	top
	bottom
	between
	outside
who owns the dividers space?
set_focus (panel)
	who owns the focus?
	gfx(curses)?
	get_char -> gfx_get_char -> consider focus
on close panel, focus moves to
	*prev*/next sibling, or parent?
	due to mutt's UI focus moves to prev sibling
how can I show focus without moving anything? i.e. borders
	sacrifice a top line?
	border highlight?  => always present
which panels *accept* focus?
	sidebar
	index window
	pager window
	<tab> to switch?
	or <left>, <right>?

<sidebar-next-new> => $sidebar_flagged_are_new ?

website: some bug-fixes have gone away -> success page?
set/unset sidebar_visible doesn't refresh screen when in pager
sb doesn't match folder (for open) if it has a trailing /

∀ new bugfixes -- reference trac number in commit message

	markdown?

get travis to build RPMs on neomutt and deploy to github release's artifacts automatically
website front page: do YOU have a mutt patch? -> contact us
website collection of changes since last release -> relnotes on release
	note which branches, etc

<sidebar-refresh> function to forcibly refresh screen & counts after, e.g.
	unmailboxes *
	mailboxes lots...

new hierarchy: tree => mail's parent is folder or mail

	news: newspaper
	devel: jigsaw, spanner&screwdriver
	release: present, balloons

use links(1) as a model for re-architecting mutt
	mouse control (inc right-click)
	safe html rendering
	pop-up windows
or mc (midnight commander)

update website gh page: list of branches
neomutt FAQ -- containing what?
add my gpg signing key to neo.org, fc.org

fmemopen - merge into one place in mutt_mktemp()?
	idea from dgc email
sidebar, when saving email to a folder use the sidebar as a selector?
	new indicator colour or prompts "select save folder" + normal highlight
Do drafts *need* to be stored in a separate folder?
	why not inline?
	in threaded order
	just tagged or coloured
	status flag to denote draft
email David Sterba (kdave) -- limit
	use context, or change prototypes
screenshots on website
neomutt version on website home page

doc travis and coverity options
split source?
	tools/ - standalone exes
	library/ - replacement library functions
	readme/ - obvious

save email doesn't respect the umask

kdave - limit-current-thread
	alt-l (show limit) should respond "limit thread"
	is "limit ." the same as "limit all" -- YES
		fixed internally
	create unlimit patch and pull-request for kdave?
	limit doesn't have any context, just a pattern
	limit-current-thread NEEDS to know current email
	it'd be nice to change limit to accept another "string" arg
	currently
		"all" -> "~A"
	change limit
		"thread" -> "~a" (only letter available)
		let general limit machinery do the work
	unfortunately they can't see the current email

rewrite mutt_wstr_trunc()
	first, rename variables to be something sensible
	second, refactor to be legible

vim library of config options(vars)
	auto-extract from init.h

kill version.c:rstrip_in_place()
	fix external build scripts

what does Sidebar *really* need?
	Incoming BUFFY -> notifications of BUFFY changes
	Panel (geometry) -> notifications of WINCH
	character libraries -> lengths, widths, formatting, etc
	options (config access)
	colours
	curses: clear(panel), clear(line), write (char/string), move(x,y)
		curses calls are all (0,0)-based
		curses takes panel object and converts to screen coordinates
		∀ users
	callbacks for functions
	sb is initialised with (Panel pointer), notifications on change
	can query Panel's size, position (not useful), visibility
	panel can be visible, but !active, e.g. partially under a modal dialog
		=> paint if asked, but won't receive keys
		could still be asked to do stuff by dialog, etc

how about modal dialogs?
	1 dialog could invalidate sidebar, index, pager
	sibling to sidebar, index, pager but last in list (z-order)
	sb, index, panel get painted, then "floating" window gets painted over
	modal => disable key mappings/propagation

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside area of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

attach sets of keybindings to panel hierarchy?
modify docs generation to process commands' comments
can some keybindings be set "only active when window is visible"?
	=> help doesn't (necessarily) hide sidebar
		should sidebar keys work?  probably not
	*should* help hide the sidebar?
		probably yes

sidebar indented folders
	fill in gaps in hierarchy automatically
	make them non-selectable (unless the user has "mailboxes" them)
	alternatively, have some way to mark mailboxes as "fake"
		probably a horrible idea

separate draw() in sidebar for
	emails
	notmuch
	nntp
	addressbook?

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

manual "variables" need description field

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

cond-date needs some concrete examples

change docs to use <example>

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

docs refer to alias menu but don't mention how to invoke it
browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

use sort_aux for nested sidebar names?
	no, sub-folders are same type?
		no
	YES: allows to sort by name, then subsort by new-count
	separate variable otherwise it interferes with index, etc

community script check for update
	date community docs?
	or just rely on commit date?

git hook variables
	prepare-commit-msg
	GIT_DIR
	GIT_WORK_TREE
	GIT_INDEX_FILE
	GIT_PREFIX
	GITHEAD_XXX

auto-generate merge commit messages
	modified git log msg
	script for authors
	commented out - but accessible?

replace " with ' in muttrc

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

docs/muttrc/readme/init.h
	need to document default values for variables

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

git
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar

break up and rewrite mutt docs
	break into smaller sections
	separate mutt-doc repo
	translate sections (default to english if missing)

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

cache sidebar formatted strings on BUFFY object?

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares
	gperf to generate perfect hashes

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

keep revision number for all config items (as a prelude to proper notifications)
	only increment revision number on change
	leads to possible A-B-A problem (change blindness)
	if (ver(format_str) > old_ver) STMT;
	allows code to make informed decisions about caching

which config items require frequent and costly interpretation?
	all format strings -- every line, every refresh

data source LDAP
	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

Alternate views in the sidebar
	need toggle function
	imap: folders  <--> dir tree
	local: folders <--> dir browser

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistant undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

integrate nntp into sidebar
what does notmuch return?
	how do i link it to existing objects?

sb extra colours for:
	readonly mailboxes
		expando?
	bad (non-existent) mailboxes
		expando?
	virtual mailboxes
	what other attrs?
	colour by SRC
	separate colour schemes by SRC?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate BUFFYs
sidebar needs NO-selection possibility for toggle-virtual
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

sb expandos
	compare letters to status_format letters
	deleted?
	number after limiting
	unread?

postpone patch doesn't quite work
	1) The PostContext and menu are private, so sidebar can't tell that
	   we're looking at the postponed list after navigation.
	2) After navigating to another folder, you still have to "quit" to
	   get the display to refresh.

alternative to lightweight patch
	don't update info ∀ BUFFYs
	just update the current page
	only update lists when the user OPENs a folder
	not when they move the highlight
	could pre-emptively populate the previous/next pages

sidebar expandos
	%c number of non-deleted emails (total - deleted)
	%s = %c? (lower case version of %S?)

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
break up init.h, globals.h, functions.h
	init.h option DELEGATE, prefix "sidebar_", callback?
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, buffy.c, mh.c
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
separate modules -- sidebar, index, pager, help? -- each with
	init()
	notify()
	close()
	config()
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

can the real status bar display any sidebar fields?
	why not?
	how can they be integrated?

Unmailbox * ⇒  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

tree chars for sidebar hierarchy?

Start; Incoming; Inbox open; current = Incoming; sort → cur is offscreen, boundaries lost

draw sidebar
	assumes position/size
	move due to STATUSONTOP, HELP
	check of show/hidden has changed & refresh numbers if nec
	if hidden, do nothing
	sanity check settings
	draw divider (3 chars!)
for all buffers
	set colour
	move
	gen displayname (need to cache this)
		name, bytelen, screenlen
		what about config changes
			including sort order
	make sidebar_entry
fill remaining lines with blanks

Sidebar actions (that might precipitate change):
	line-up
	line-down
	page-up
	page-down
	set buffy from browser
	change sort order
	add mailbox
	delete mailbox
	change mailbox's sort criteria (e.g. flag an email, a flagged-sorted mailbox)
	resize window
	hide sidebar
	show sidebar
	open folder

Notify (Box*, Rect old, Rect new, flags)
Flags:
	too small to render
	changed visibility

Changed posn notification ONLY
	e.g. sidebar has swapped sides
could imply that cached data may be OK to reuse
	e.g. don't need to call calc_boundaries

repaint if:
	size changes
	position changes

DBUS plugin -- to do what?
	notify out
	take input to do what?
		accept mailto: links

quiet config option -- don't whine about unknown config options
	or quiet command line option

sb_draw should return success of drawing
	possible given all the callbacks, etc?

trim trailing slash from mailboxes, folder
	shouldn't be displayed

New only -- include structure (empty dirs) to keep hierarchy
	mail (0)
	  fruit (0)
	    apple (1)

sorting
	if displaying full paths:
		sort by display name
		sort by underlying name
	if displaying indented paths:
		sort by top-level names, then children

sidebar_width = auto (size to contents)
	would need to parse and format all strings ahead of drawing divider

possible to fix sidebar sort order to respect hierarchy/indentation?

need attention
	draw_sidebar
	OPTSIDEBARSORT
		sorts by real path, not visible name

sidebar_dividers
	first (wide) character is vertical divider
		between sidebar and index/pager
	second (wide) character is horizontal divider
		between different mailboxes (within the sidebar)

send escape sequence to clear terminal title when mutt closes
init.h struct option_t needs enums for types and union for data
timer notifications, e.g.
	highlight something for three seconds, then return to normal
https://github.com/N8Fear/mutt-kz
	some initialisations improvements
	some bug fixes

wrapping →
	extra char at beginning of line "+"
	extra char at end of line "<-/"
wrap at:
	char
	word (whitespace)
	clause (punctuation)
	sentence (.!?)
No wrap →
	extra char at end of line ">"

Window changes
	hidden  no params
	visible rect
	resize  rect
	focus   in/out
colours changes
keypress        key, no params
config change   key, value
		ALL, no params
mail status change
	read/unread/flagged/deleted/edited
	MESSAGE_ID, flags
mailbox change
	new/deleted
	new mail, deleted mail, flagged mail, etc
connection status
	connected
	disconnected
startup
quitting - any use to anyone?
selected mail changed
selected mailbox changed
