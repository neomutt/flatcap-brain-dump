Is there any way to capture and refer back to the address captured by 'send2-hook ~t %s' in a backtick command on the right-hand side?
	e.g. ~t "jim@host.com"  ->  set varible = "\1"  (meaning jim@host.com)
	hmm... not easily, because we'd have to de-construct the pattern
	"~t jim@example.com" is easy enough, but what about "~t jim | ~t bob"
	hmm... if the pattern-matching code were able to tell the caller _which_ part of the pattern matched
	patterns are only ever matched against one type of object, but we wouldn't be able to tell which field
	mutt_pattern_exec() would return: MUTT_PAT_TO, "jim@example.com"

$smart_wrap doesn't apply to email headers
	should it?

add expandos for mailbox/email to pipe/filter commands
	e.g. my_command --title "%s"
	for the email subject

generate y/n regex from our "yes" and "no" translations
	to work around OpenBSD's lack of working nl_langinfo()

bug
	three accounts wth imap_check_subscribed fail
		apple@host.com
		banana@host.com
		cherry@host.com
	tries to lsub cherry's mailboxes to plain "host.com"
	need upstreams fix b48f8e1e

visual glitch at time of sending mail?
	sidebar always gets updated and refreshed ahead of other windows!
	
make mail_check_stats default to YES?
	most people will want it

ideas for REALLY deeply nested emails:
	The number of replies is much more than 100
	1) In index view center subject if message is under cursor.
	2) Limit the maximal offset of discussions in index view.

make all notification objects const?
	possible?

rename op_XYZ() functions to fn_&?
	probably no, but need to de-dupe them

file browser, add (toggle-able) live preview window
	mailcap the current selection into the window
	need focus control or duplicate set of motion functions

guideline for mutt_{message,warning,error}
	would you want the message to interrupt a macro running?
	mutt_error() => stop macro?
	mutt_warning() => print/queue during macro?
	mutt_message() => ignore during macro?
	option to ignore erros duing macro run?

"uncolor status" doesn't work
	"uncolor status regex" does work
	can't undo base colour

is there a security? reason that we don't log all gpg commands?
	all the gpg commands go through: ncrypt/pgpinvoke.c:226

mutt_query_exit()
	on Ctrl-C, Y, don't exit(1)
	set a global that causes the dialog stack to collapse?
	potentially allow the backends to close down gracefully

color command doesn't update pager!
	`color header fg bg .`
	it would mean re-rendering the email to re-embed the colour codes
	setting SigWinch=1 forces the issue

reduce CI cost:
	only run most test for test/NAME branches

colours:
	add flags to definitions?  TAKES_REGEX?
	add callback parse function?

struct Email: adding notify changed the struct
	check hcache version is diff for release

docs: add page describing all config types
	including all flags (subtypes)
	
nntp: allow sub/unsub in index/pager

coverage: check dev analysis docs for new 'coverage' dir

<thread><function>, <subthread> to act without tagging
	like <tag-prefix>, add "-prefix" to above?

elim Neomutt->sub from libmutt, then elim config

nntp docs:
	document '?' on screen to browse after 'i'

multi-line error messages?  HOW?

config parsing revamp
	track stack of files 'source'd
	track line numbers
	batch mode flag -> do nothing for gui config like 'color'
	cache locations of config
		like vim's `:verbose set x`
	need framework to delegate parsing

split Menu and Pager
	Menu for selectable *items*
	pager for text
	=> elim Menu->dialog[]

add stats page:
	email stats about one email?
		size, headers, etc?
	mailbox stats
		num emails, num uniq addr/recipients, size
	click on num addrs for *list* of addrs
		user can act on list: email, alias, etc
	stats on all mailboxes, number, size
	email stats across all mailboxes?
	try to limit info to that in header cache for speed

github action
	check for @file header, etc
	*.c need config.h
	*.h need include guard
	check for empty line at eof
	*.c @page
	"calc" undoc'd functions
	shellcheck

Live log message window (for devs?)
	magic height
	shown when several messages arrive in 1s => show all
	Ctrl-L clear
	list for logging (needs notify)
	follow log, always at end (no user interaction?)
	top-level window.  where?
		side -> narrow
		bottom -> short
	page up/down could cause more logging!
	simple interactions would have to be log free

add dev docs for all --debug/--devel configure options
	link to docs from ./configure --help

in future with external event loop,
	macros can be executed in one go, without refreshes
	currently the keys get put into the buffer
	then the index/pager/etc executes them individually
	perhaps the user *wants* to see feedback for the macro?
	-> <silent> (<verbose>) surrounds
	end of macro -> !<silent>
	nested macros will depend on if <verbose> were used in any
	(cf vim lazyredraw, :silent)

behaviour on multiple error messages?
	stop action on first?
	tell use to read <show-log-messages>
	or a counter "error... (+2)"
	or 1 sec timeout & queue

why no <tag-pattern> in alias dlg?

widescreen
	demo vimeo
	winch hooks
	start with ordinary screen
	sidebar, index lines, pager
	demo making window narrower/wider, taller/shorter
	narrower -> sidebar hidden, wider -> sidebar restored
	taller: index lines increase, short index lines hidden

config errors
	file:linenum: error
	print offending line
	(+E1234?)
	tidy filenames with '~' for errors
	or relative to '.'

merge gfx repo into website /gfx ?

eliminate fallthroughs - use functions

banned.h
	sprintf -> snprintf
	etc

config: allow dupe registrations
	iff they are identical:flags, type, default

socket: add timeout code

safari77 : mutt_sidebar repo

RFC6154 - set imap trash sent/record automatically?

rtlexpand
	add build option?
	add to make (dist)clean?
	DISTCLEAN_TARGETS

build
	add --undefined for ubsan
	add debug prefix for asan option

rename (synonym) <save-message> to <move-message>

CHECK: neomuttrc.5 is correctly built (not missing */config.c)

bug: pager: $wrap=0 doesn't clear '+'s at beginning of line

add $imap_context like nntp to limit to recent emails

add <function> for graphviz dump?

too many <delete-*> functions -- need one which can be configured

refactor all notify_observer_remove to use the supplied notify object

change one-liner help to be useful as an error message when setting config?
	see translate.txt

add graphviz to analysis web page
	and coveralls

replace greeting, attribution, signature, etc
	%{greeting} ... %{attribution} ... %{signature}
	mail-merge for one-off emails

pattern for matching mime/types?

./configure /tmp
	notify packagers

reference CONTRIBUTING.md in newbie-tutorial

(un)focus-hook
	change check_stats timings!

hcache metadata - be specific about Mailbox maildir:/path

Email.path -> edata (mbox, maildir only? compressed?) notmuch?

Email.*gui* -> Email.view {} move to end of struct

devel_new_mail_command
	for maildir only (for now)
	log command output
	not on screen unless failed

testing maildir
	need functions to (create/move/delete) (mailboxes/emails)

add visual feedback for SIGINT-interruptability?
	is this just synonymous with progress bar?
	probably

eliminate helper functions
	compress_get_ops()
	compr_get_ops()
	etc
	store the state somewhere and use that instead

event scripting
	<gahr> I want an integration with a scripting language
	<jindraj> lua?
	<gahr> and the integration is event driven
	<gahr> jindraj: I don't care too much
	<flatcap> who are you?  and what have you done with gahr?
	<gahr> so neomutt issues events like key_pressed, or message_opened
	<gahr> and those functions are implemented in a script and can call to neomutt commands
	<flatcap> that would be very nice...
	<gahr> key_pressed(key) { if (key == 'a') { neomutt::open_folder('imaps://....') }
	<flatcap> but I'm damned if I know how you'll do it!
	<gahr> you'd get rid of macros, folder-hooks, everything
	<gahr> just events
	<flatcap> one of my reasons for refactoring the dialogs is as preparation for moving the main event loop...
	<flatcap> i'd like one getch() in main() that distributes events to the "focussed window" (or wherever)
	<flatcap> it would also include timers (so we can get rid of the imap code in the getch())
	<flatcap> delegating events to a script would be simple

focus in/out. useful?
	https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/480138/417458
	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html
	There's a FocusIn/FocusOut mode. To enable:
		echo -ne '\e[?1004h'
	To disable:
		echo -ne '\e[?1004l'
	On each focus event, you receive either \e[I (in) or \e[O (out) from the input stream.

allow <limit> in the pager, so the user can
	<limit><enter> to refresh the index

*live* limit (config option?)
	limit is reapplied after any action
	`~N` limit: emails disappear after reading (e.g. in Pager)

<jindraj>
	I know about one case when tag prefix doesn't work.
	When you use internal pager and have pager_index_lines set to some positive number.
	Tag multiple messages, open any message, then tag prefix doesn't work, all actions are applied only to a opened message.
	It may be misleading because you can see the messages tagged.
<tag-prefix> isn't implemented for the pager
	should it be?

on mailbox_sync()
	does the frontend *know* what's changed?
	should sync() be given a subset of E?
	what benefit?  rest might change anyway (externally)

sort_alias default to "unsorted"?
	since it affects the query menu

pinned issues
	I need help - how to ask for help, how to write a good issue
	I want to help - how to join us
	I want to thank you - star, donate, help, "thanks" -> irc

notmuch address search, adjusted to neomutt query format
	notmuch address --output=sender %s | sed 's/\(.*\) <\(.*\)>$/\2\t\1/'
	notmuch address --output=count --output=sender %s | sed 's/\([0-9]\+\)\t\(.*\) <\(.*\)>$/\3\t\2\t# \1/'

pager:
	option to turn off wrapping
	then have functions to scroll left/right?

expandos
	option / mechanism to show which fields have been truncated `â€¦` 
	HOW?
	alter formatting syntax %-min.maxS ?
	or add extra expandos for selected big fields
	%s (subject), %st (subject truncation-marked)

webpage: how to debug neomutt problems
	bisect config
	null config

Alias colours for deleted, tagged, search
	(or defined some standard names/colours for these states)
	add vim's hls option
	use notmuch-style colours, abbrs for labels (icons)
	combine colours
	vim's hls only highlight matched part
		colour line, highlight match!

add build and analysis pages to welcome email
	revamp newbie page

dlg_verify_certificate() only user of Menu.dialog
	like pager with (m)enu selection
	separate windows!
	pager (handling paging keys)
	message window (handling menu keys)
	message window has focus, delegates to pager

[] move the view 1/2 page (viewport)
	add keys to move +/- 1 line (^E, ^Y)
	hook up to the mouse?

Add more warnings to default build?

pop
	auth change while -> for * 2
	PopAuth.method -> name?

when deprecating config, etc
	display links to website giving details

giving the Mailboxes a monotonic sequence number
	(as their unsorted order)
	means dividers wouldn't need to be the same type
	as their siblings (wouldn't be grouped by Account)
	when sidebar_sort_method=unsorted

mailcap doesn't accept */*
	(as a fallback)

tidy, doc, publish all build/parallel scripts
	build-scripts repo

option to reverse the direction of $resolve
	for users that `set sort=reverse-date`

pattern help
	complete on % too
	list %patterns in help

limit neomutt support to versions less than
	n years / m months old

change config errors to file:line for easier vim
	where else are file / line nums used?
	mutt_debug(LL_DEBUG1, "%s:%d: ERROR: unlink(\"%s\"): %s (errno %d)\n", src, line, buf, strerror(errno), errno);
	mutt_debug(LL_DEBUG1, "%s:%d: ERROR: unlink(\"%s\"): %s (errno %d)\n", src, line, mutt_b2s(buf), strerror(errno), errno);

	mutt_warning(_("Warning in %s, line %d: %s"), rcfile, lineno, err->data);

mouse scroll should move viewport (natural)
	rather than focus
	add $option?
	should allow highlight and indicator to move offscreen
	$devel_mouse = yes?

doxy - missing docs for send config
	no `///< Config:` comments

searching: pattern expansion using simple_search
	`apple` will be expanded using $simple_search
	`apple | ~f foo` won't
		it will fail because `apple` isn't valid
	can we apply the checks and expansion to each part?
	would the result still be predictable?

function/setting to turn off confirmations whilst in a macro
	might make functions unpredictable
	unless there's some visual feedback

master -> main -- when?
	after release

SIGWINCH - only root window should be listening
	sends out Window Events on change
	need ALL dialogs to be listening, first

nntp_auth() split up into separate functions, like other backends?

open address book with <open-address-book>

delegate Config object to NeoMutt (don't free it separately)
NV NeomuttView => ndata & free_ndata - wrap gui globals

âˆ€ types
âˆ€ levels N|A|M
âˆ€ (name|HE)
âˆ€ (get|set)
âˆ€ (native|string)

level	HE
N	* --> Global
	^
	|
A	* (value)
	^
	|
M	* (value)

lookups with missing HE -> string
manipulations to generate scope, etc
lookup on unchanged M mean 2 redirects
if M-value is looked at *once*, it's likely to be again
	so always generate

N-sub or Globals âˆ€ code?
	N-sub where possible
	then convert to (scope-)-sub later

create_inheritance needs to honour INH_ACC|INH_MBOX
if config *can't* be inherited, will all lookups be inefficient?  probably
or drop flags - inherit anything, code will decide N|A|M
NO. need flags to warn user (flags to match code)
inherit where A-sub or M-sub are used
need flags for config dump (add to :set output)
does INH_MBOX imply INH_ACC?  probably
	specify both for clarity?  YES
need to categorise all Config
	NONE (global)
	Account-specific
	Mailbox-specific
	447 config variables

Pass sub to dialogs -- their config scope
What if dlg needs some A- and some M-specific config?
Dlg given M-sub, searching for A-limited config will cause M-inherit!
All gui-config is global -- initially
All index/page config is M-specific, compose too
Alias/query is global
Who checks config setting?  parse_set?  validator?

	use localised version of email where available
	then vim-tutor like

Account observes config
{user,pass,login} -> set_X
url change -> wipe settings, set all

need service name "imap", etc
globals - need to parameterise:
	$tunnel
	$preconnect
	$use_ipv6
	$connect_timeout

ConfigAccount - cached credentials (rename?)
if (!has_X) get(X)
	function callback to Account

mx_open -> imap_open -> socket -> sasl (missing creds) -> connect
	sasl needs to ask user for info
	ssl/tls need to validate certificates

missing credentials (before connect) - has to happen here
	*sasl* might ask questions
	accept/reject cert (mid-connect)
		pass in response for testing purposes?
	NO have special version of libquestion

magic pager bar too
create index/pager macros that save/restore
	pager_index_lines
	sidebar_visible
	pager_format
	save to myvars
	if ifdef to only need one macro?

M.verbose for messages -> notification?
	let UI decide if quiet or not

main reuses Buffer *folder confusingly?

main - folder-hook is called before startup-hook
	should it?

pop_fetch_mail()
	move spoolfile, $folder out of pop/

ConnAccount needs method to *push* data
	e.g. ask for a password, then Account saves to config

lots of sidebar settings apply to the browser
	should be account display settings!

folder format needs 'subscribed' flag/field

format format use %l (hard links) to distinguish local/net browser formats (conditional)

:changelog ?
	read from /usr/share/doc/neomutt

	good for asking questions too
	"pop/gui.c" all the wrappers

Add Imap seq letter/fd to all logs?
	need imap_debug() macro

137 WHERE uses

create mailbox (browser)
	errors on empty -- kill error
	rename, delete too?

{backend}/hcache.c?
	no, hcache shouldn't be in backends

change OP_X to exactly match function name?

split up MxOps?
	have backends register their functions?

split mx.c mx_{ac,mbox,msg,path,tags}.c

{backend}/{ac,mbox,msg,path,tags}.c âˆ€

Distinguish all IMAP logging by its connection details
	create imap_debug() macro
	add prefix field to log_dispatcher_t
	all the functions using mutt_debug() need an adata param/local
	use prefix of [seqid/fd]

new sort option to sort flagged emails first
	include entire thread?

have HomeDir, create CurrentDir for cwd?
	it doesn't change

named mailboxes - check "name" is unique across *A*
compare local fs using dev id, inode id

	it doesn't change (yet)

A is global, outside of parse(M, a, etc) so
split parse? for imap to use?  where is A subst?
M-fn(M-str, A (optional)), parse uses stack. imap uses A-self
M-str is de-escaped, de-quoted

	notifies to another part of self to update frontent array
	frontend behaves as normal during transition

memory usage
	where's it all going?
	need tree of objects
	visitor sizeof()!
	:memory command

create more easy tasks (investigate)
	pin issue

tabs for accounts - steal space from helpbar (if visible)
	on left?
	on right?
tab name needs format string for "*" notifications
preset, coloured blobs?

for popup windows, or non-focussed, *dim* other windows
	want to preserve indicator presence
	color dim_{text,indicator,bar}
	if unset, don't dim?

	how would the sidebar/maildir declare/process the option?

Window observer WIN_DELETE as d'tor!

cli text mode option - sets $ascii_chars
	how can we do this automatically?

add capability to use external browser to attach files in compose
	it returns a list of files
	e.g. vifm

docs: two types of dialog: pager, index
	plus passive windows

use `ifdef` to test if file exists?
	syntax?
	new command instead?
	or <silent> option?

off-by-one pager_index_lines doesn't include ibar
sidebar will become the same when divider is in a separate window!
what about users that share config between old/new neomutt (or upstream mutt)?

merge gfx/arch diagrams into doxygen docs?
	where?  how?
	link from dev page

Config
	rather than C_X = val; fn(); C_X = oldval
	create tmp *subset* with that one value changed!
	isolates change from other code/readers/threads!
	will that work?
	if A:M:Cfg and set plain Cfg?
	if unnamed subset, will normal inheritance still work?

"builtin" lots of refs left in docs/code

shellcheck on hcachever.sh

struct Pager -> PagerInfo?

move file deletion out of page
	which callers can be fixed?

iwyu - need review of *
	whitelisted includes - how often?
	list source exceptions
	mutt_curses.h
	review: del all pragmas - try compiling
	create [iwyu] top-level travis branch?
	exceptions are still hard-coded into scripts
	5 files - might be reducible

help_line_format - put custom text at the top
	tie in with account-hooks, macros, etc
	for reminders, etc

compose menu using its own is_tagged
	use EmailList instead
	+5 others in index. nec?
	change subordinates to take EL

mutt_sort_headers actually sorted Emails

status bar idea:
	empty status_format -> do not draw
	using conditional expandos that evaluate to an empty string -> do not draw

debug refresh idea: use greyscale background
	increment each repaint
	need to combine colours
	would need bitfield or flag (changed & visible) on Mailboxes
	or each window has a repaint count
		need way to reset occasionally
		Ctrl-L?

add 'sleep' command
	useful for macros
	allow fractional seconds
	can lua do this instead?

easy: mxapi: mbox_create/delete()
then add to browser, need exists fn too

mxapi open_append - move create? query to neo
backend->does_mailbox_exist()
	no, query user
	be->create_mailbox() OK
	be->open_mailbox()

Mailbox, Email - rearrange members: pure data first, connecting pointers,
	see #1870
	private data, last view data - move into inline View struct?
	move into external view struct?
	func data is from file/server - no config required, no globals
	use hcache as guide to purity of data
	Email shrinks from 192 bytes to 32
	Body shrinks from 176 bytes to 24
	Envelope is 344 bytes

no such mailbox -> link to docs
	fake mailboxes

project "next release"
	rename to "2019-MM-DD" after release
	notes, triage, todo, done

VIM update

split up management repo?

new form for error messages?  two-lines
	first line has error message: "Can't open folder"
	second line has the place: folder, path, url, etc
	simplifies translation strings
	can highlight path
	path less likely to be truncated/wrapped

pager <change-folder>?<enter>q goes back to pager

log macro actions carefully

log all hooks

$folder = /dev/null
	leads to crash (not repeated)

config: can't un*set* enum!

postponed docs don't contain the work "draft"!

post-send hook for doing stuff

M must exist
	what about "sent" or "trash" folders?  which might not
	option to create (silently) missing Mailboxes?
	could be messy

help: macros with descriptions are truncated
	can't see full-text
	need wrapping

account-hook is #ifdef SOCKET!

cli(debug) mailbox dump, print index to screen width formatted
	coloured, batch mode, retval like -z, -Z
	or just dump *new* mail
	multiple mailboxes too, separated by M's path?
	json/xml output?
	eventually split into separate app using libmutt, etc
	use getopt_long -- all platforms >10y

Feature: when entering a field, print errors on the line above
	alternaively, *insert* entry field below message window
	it's empty and invsible unless used!
	could use for completion matches too

mutt_buffer_mktemp() ought to live in muttlib! because of config etc
	buffer.c should have no dependencies (except memory, string)

config validators - allow to change value, clamp, ignore "builtin"

eliminate config.h âˆ€ .h (29) start with libs

Narrow sidebar idea, when width = 1 (or 2)
	abbreviate to single letter
	use colour to show new (or icon)
	position gives you a clue where new mail is
	width=1 no divider, use bg colour to distinguish from index/pager

rename var tmpfile (it's a libc fn)

drop all email addrs from docs (except mine?)

which commands *might* have observers?
	sidebar fns don't know about/if there's a sidebar!

command events, pass Commands[] index, no other data needed

ACS_VLINE(sb) -> create primitives draw_line(), draw_box()!

eliminate all strtoX(), use mutt_str_strtoX()

Config (accept-disabled-config)
	enable by default
	allow distros to disable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

init base windows main()
(compartmentalised world)
index creates dialog - tree, diagram
dialog has data (state including current Mailbox)
sidebar init -> window
	sb_init(dlg) -> inserts itself
	show data tree to A->M

Index <sb-open> -> sb_fn(open) -> dlg.set_current(M) - index processes
	send notify M changed (sb listens -> need recalc)
Index calls reflow/repaint on dlg, sg reacts, repaints.  Done

On window drag resize, when are recalc/repaints done?
Drag (horizontal) -> SIGWINCH -> reflow root -> *some* windows notify size
(sb no action), (index need recalc), repaint root, skip sb, repaint index DONE
Drag (vertical) (helpbar no change), others repaint

separate re*calc* from re*paint* stages for cleaner refresh?
	functions in Window: recalc, repaint, handle function()
Index->find(ID_SIDEBAR) in dlg, call sb(win, x, y, z)
sb->find(ID_INDEX) in dlg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

idea: magic wrap - regex to ignore wrapping for URLs etc
	or $no_wrap_split

lower case attrset not wrapped!

docs: check paths are correct
	/usr/share/docs/sample

debug-only MARKER logging âˆ€ colour code paths
	all valid, all error, all dupes, all uncolor non-existent
	if not markers, comments âˆ€
	LL_MARKER (#ifdef DEBUG) level7 just for testing?

how many ways are there to reply?
	how many config vars/lots affect reply?
	alternates, aliases, bounce, reply-to:, etc
	flowchart?  too complicated?

allow "uncolor obj" for normal objects -> default default (no attrs)
	+ attach_headers, staus, uncolor needs retval

libgui - new logging level?

wrap ColorQuote array, get_quote_color(n)?
use ifndef in /etc/neomuttrc to disable *some* defaults
	colours, bindings

challenge - preserve order of tagged emails, so that
	copy/save occurs in the proscribed order
- need to add to EL_tagged as it happens
- maildir (dest) needs to tweak timestamps to ensure order
  (or save to mbox instead)
tweaking can't happen in backend -- it only sees one file at a time
need MXAPI for fast copy for when src & dst backends are the same
change maildir to use (save to) timestamp, if set (NOW, if not)
saving emails to IMAP, what are files in underlying maildir?
	files timestampted for most recent (topmost)
	received timestamp
mx_msg_open_new(), mutt_safe_message()
maildir_msg_open_new(), md_commit_message()

BUG: hooks not run on initial "mailboxes" command, but are later

LEAK: buffer pool, alias groups (not *owned*)

BUG: "set charset" should call mutt_ch_set_charset()

CHECK: other NOT_EMPTY config isn't emptied by reset

GH Label has:workaround

VERIFY: no leaks, no UB, âˆ€ startup pats
CHECK: -T output (drop or #ifdef)

in:  echo `sleep 10 &`
	ampersand isn't honoured
	problem upstream too
	it IS in honoured elsewhere

fopen âˆ€ log path & fd
	log fd on close
	macro to get FILE, LINE, FUNCTION
	err Buffer too?
	need flags for perms

symlinks
	when should symlinks be resolved?
	should neomutt show the resolved or unresolved path?

attach_save_dir config
	DT_*DIR* must be dir or non-existent
	stop trailing '/'
	if exists, warn if not writeable
	warn if non-dir
	hmm... default is "./" -> "."
	DT_FILE, no trailing '/'
		if exists, writeable
		or non-existent

endwin(); printf(); refresh()
	makes output go to 'normal' screen
		can be coloured!
	NO flicker
	save the output of ALL commands
	and log it twice: to LOG and normal screen

tag emails, then save|copy -- no progress

shrink 'code' repo, or replace empty and restart
	exclude from mirroring

configure allows --gnutls AND --ssl
	need to warn/fail

:toggle abc<tab>
	should it only complete to booleans/quads? etc

context sensitive help
	use index selection
	e.g. mailing list specific
	index help should be backend-specific

mail_check_stats(_interval) -- A-specific
	use *un*folder-hook to have different settings for
	current and 'other' accounts

log_disp_debug_terminal
	*everything* to stdout

notify_remove() needs data for exact match

<quiet> option for <pipe-message> and <shell-escape>
	logs output raw to neomutt debug log
	mutt_error() if it fails

feature: live filter index as you type, cf sidebar matcher
	fuzzy?

neo maildir header/message cache
	auto-add README.md, saying
	"auto-generated"
	"safe to delete anything"
	list settings for the cache

like lkml backend, run notmuch on IMAP as background task
	select Account/Mailboxes you want to index
	work backwards from NOW
	apply to new mail
	unapply to deleted mail (or tag)
	unapply to trashed mail (or tag)
	implies notmuch is a transparent layer over backend
		for maildir, imap, lkml, nntp
	need rules to cull old entries
	might need separate databases
	better as an external prog?
	notmuch layer listens for new-mail, del-mail notifications, etc

create sample code for inline and out-of-line STAILQ use and others
	where to put it
	use apple and banana gist
	https://gist.github.com/flatcap/105cd65e37d89fc434b2b632e85c3702
	add diagrams
	list users (or helper classes)

save option for summary page info

change "hidden_tags" to be a regex? (#1744)
	backwards-compatible how?
	look for '(' ')' '*' '|' ?
	how do we store it in Config if it has two possible types?

tmp *dir* per email
	mostly unused? NO
	lifetime of email
	save attachments in it

newbie question
	how does mail get into neomutt
	What's an MUA?

<f1> for context sensitive help
	<f2> for help on last error received?
	create functions

dump-config
	INDENT option for A-,M-specific

dump-config SHOW_DOCS option
	if $xyx is inherited, then show and document the base value
	don't doc inherited value
	if base value isn't changed from default, comment it out

deferred config evaluation
	automatic for sensitive variables?
	global contains `script.sh` get_value() evaluates the backticks
	can't be done by config system, only outside can eval ``s
	need to be careful to avoid double evaluation
	don't want backends evaluating ``s either (transparent)

core lib
	NeoMutt, Config, Account, Mailbox, Notify
	can it be made independent?
		need to de-gui Email, etc
	core depends on mutt,address,email libs
	config depends on mutt,address,core libs
	backends will depend on mutt,config,email,address,core
		plus ncrypt,conn

docs: "Since: YYYY-MM-DD (or version)"
	drop after 1 year

mutt_get_name() shouldn't be in sort.c
	NO, it's used

embedded editor
	how?  pty's cf screen/tmux
	can screen/tmux nest?

split travis targets using github checks api
	skip if not relevant
	state: queued, in progress, complete

feature:
	create prefix commands
	<sidebar-open> becomes <sidebar><open>
	same for <thread>, <subthread>
		<limit-current-thread> -> <thread><limit>
	would this break the `bind` command?
		or allow an exception for <prefix> + <function>?
	just <open> means open the default thing with focus
	use also for <skip-deleted><next> / <prev>
	<focus> prefix to be explicit

different lists for different jobs?
	email/email.h defines `struct Email`
	Index needs an EmailViewList of EmailViewNode (for gui stuff)
	Notifications needs an EmailNotifyList of EmailNotifyNode (for diff notify types)

context-sensitive help should work âˆ€ prompts,
	e.g. 's' to save email, default location comes up,
	<f1> opens page about saving and the 'save-hook'

changing the option strings to the form
	(1a)pple, (2b)anana, (3c)herry
	1(a)pple, 2(b)anana, 3(c)herry
means the translators would be free to reorder the options
and we could eliminate the "abc" letter string
this doesn't look so good
	app1(l)e, bana2(n)a, che3(r)ry
perhaps
	app(1l)e, bana(2n)a, che(3r)ry
or clearer still
	(1:a)pple, (2:b)anana, (3:c)herry
	app(1:l)e, bana(2:n)a, che(3:r)ry
the numbers could even be omitted
if the translated string matches the order of the original
what about purely numbered questions, like crypto algorithms
	msgid "(1) apple, (2) banana, (3) cherry?"

	MI: might need access to flags

use SPDX headers?

segfault - flush log (nec?)
	log "segfault" & flush?

standardise naming "folder" vs "mailbox" âˆ€ docs

imap browser needs way to mark subscribed folders

with split views might there be multiple focused windows?
	pager1, pagerbar1
	pager2, pagerbar2
	different pagers might mean different Mailboxes
	=> statusbar1, statusbar2
parent window starts with (A,M), displays (index, pager, status) from it

use status bar/pager bar to show focus
	like vim's StatusLine{,NC} highlighting
	what about the sidebar?
	background colour change?  #101010 / #e0e0e0

User-Agent config from bool to expando?

nntp://nntp.lore.kernel.org/org.kernel.vger.linux-kernel

reset screen on segfault?
	useful when debugging

open() on open M does what?  sync()
	can't tear down M, might be other users (views)
	want to force an update, though
all updates - if they fail, try not to change M, just return -1
if conn lost, then fail, errmsg, then ??? reconnect after (timeout) or stop?
	next check_stats_interval, will try to reconnect. YES
	-1 failed => try again
	-99 fatal => stop, user must re-open -> flag?
	no fatal, for now?  make r/o if nec, ret -1
ctx_open() vs ctx_wrap() - keeps +1 refcount on M
	-1 on ctx_free()
	kill open, mbox_open() then wrap

mxapi retval -99 fatal => close and reopen
eliminate mxapi calls in BEs?  helpers?  wrappers?

eliminate context from MXAPI, mx.c -> context.c
	wrappers ctx_open(), etc
	move {mx,mailbox,account}.{c,h} to mx/
	deps mutt, email
fix postpone, trash, etc

all mx_X() functions to mailbox_X()? mx_X() for mxapi only?
	what about wrappers - i.e. most of them?

'Folder' limits the independence of mailbox.c
	limited to parse_mailboxes()?

after release
	priority to bug-fixes, tidying
	after that, help2, contrib (e.g. colourschemes)
	so that others can help us

path_canon
	check that Folder, LastFolder, etc exist before using them
	or, force set them at startup

merge mailbox.c and mx.c?

split up opcodes by action and detail (sub-action)
	18:03 <adray> You know how we define virtual-mailboxes as "MUTT_VIRTUAL | MUTT_NAMED". Would it be possible to do the same for opcodes? So instead
		of OP_MAIN_VFOLDER_FROM_QUERY_READONLY, it could be OP_MAIN_VFOLDER_FROM_QUERY | OP_READONLY?
	18:04 <adray> (this also ties into your OP_DELETE code, possible to do OP_ATTACHMENT | OP_DELETE)
	18:06 <flatcap> currently, they're an enumeration
	18:07 <flatcap> I wonder how many combinations would make sense.  how many we'd need to make it pay off
	18:10 <flatcap> hmm... quite a few
	18:10 <flatcap> all the SEARCH_X could become SEARCH | X

command to switch account - multi-selection list?  menu?

change pager for <show-log-messages> to start at end of file

.desktop for nntp:// -> neomutt

factor out the code for command "mailboxes"
	so that imap/nntp don't have to create a string
	"mailboxes QUOTED-NAME" just to have it parsed and de-quoted

create synonym <move-message> for <save-message>?

is smtp a BE?
	write-only mailbox
	auth, connection
	definitely need an smtp *dir* and tidier API for sending
	encapsulate vars in dir

reddit mailbox backend?
	see rtv project (python, curses)

rename storage globals to match the neomutt commands, e.g.
	UserHeader -> MyHdr

how does reply_regex fit into index and replying?

maintain stable numbering in the index
	(mailx does this)
	each email is given a sequential number
	new emails get a higher number
	deleted emails' numbers aren't reused
	what happens if the list is resorted?
		numbers end up randomised!
	what about patterns for message numbers
		ignore missing?
		what about -5,.
		find 5 messages, regardless of number?

connect to server using openssl

	cleanup files (not the partial emails) on exit
	e.g. attachments

Quoting
	list of special items: $var, $VAR, \n, etc
	have flags for each
	literal backslash \\
	behaviour of each unquoted, and each single quote type
	then all pairs: '"X"' or "'X'", etc
	single, double, backtick
		'X', "X", `X`
		'"X"', '`X`', "'X'", "`X`", `'X'`, `"X"`
	triple?  a lot of processing
	what about unicode curly quotes?

no pattern to search by label (or regex)
when checking for new mail, distinguish local from remote (cheap from costly)?
attach style sheet to email - mutt color commands - email-specific

	2 Drop the dated/versioned configs (nobody used them)
	3 Make a release
	4 Start deprecating muttrc (with warnings)
	5 Wait a few releases
	6 Drop muttrc

	pet peeve: when I try to open a gigabyte-sized mbox file with 10,000 messages, I cannot abort that

2016-10-24 20:54 <flip214>
	it would be very nice if switching to an imap folder could be aborted by ctrl-c
	having all headers fetched anew and having to wait for 2 mins, knowing that the wrong folder is being loaded, isn't that nice
	the counter for the headers fetched (N of M) counts up
	Ctrl-C gets ignored

19:32 <mykoserocin> is there a way to show condensed DKIM results instead of full "Authentication-Details" header?
19:32 <mykoserocin> e.g. "DKIM: pass" or "DKIM: fail"
19:52 <brendan> mykoserocin, I use the spam marker system for it: spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=pass" "âœ“"
19:52 <brendan> spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=fail" "x"

sidebar -- imap all folders vs subscribed
dovecot public mailboxes for tips?  one public user?
nntp tips? ":tips" command to toggle nntp vars and mailboxes

remote config -- like browser proxy setup

2016-08-12
	08:31 <flip214> Hi. Another thing I would love to see: an email arrives in INBOX; I answer it,
		and define the FCC for the sent mail, but the incoming mail is still in INBOX.
		so a "reply-and-move-to-same-folder" would be interesting to me.

doc -> contrib âˆ€ vimrc, muttrc
	=> will break downstream packaging
	announce change, make change in next release

transition guide:
	man neomutt
	a guide for users of mutt moving to neomutt

symlink man pages, etc (for ease of use)
	neomutt -> mutt

getopt for neomutt
	--help
	--version
		"mutt -v | head -1" is pain

sidebar
	have an alternate mailbox like vim's alternate file
	(isn't this the '-' mailbox?)
	create an alias for it '#'
	c# -> change to alternate directory
		new alternate becomes old dir
	save files to #
	set alternate mailbox function
	colour highlight for alternate mailbox
	expando %# for alternate displays '#' or ''

mutt tips on startup
	distribute a contrib/mutt-tips dir which is a mailbox
	select a random (email/tip) from the list
	pick one that's unread (preferably)
	how can we preserve the "read-ness" of an email after a package update?
	.mutt.top-tips ? -- save a list of message-ids in there?
	<top-tips> command creates a new mailbox (from DATA_DIR/DOC_DIR)
		if in /usr it would be read-only
		need to store flags elsewhere
		flags: read, flagged!, deleted (i.e. don't show me again)
	intersperse with mailboxes commands
	tips should be self-contained (to start with)
		unless they reference old tips
		nested emails?  what about multiple inheritance?
		need hyperlinking "see also" links
	use labels (from Keywords plugin) to add value
	use mutt's caching facility to store the metadata

macro instruction <no-history> like vim's <silent>
	some macros end up in the log

'ifdef' improvement
	ability to check mutt version number
	ifdef VERSION == X
	ifdef VERSION > Y
	like vim

new-mail => dbus as a goal, see dgc

		configure settings
	save config.h, etc in .git/neobuild
	neobuild --generate

sample IMAP folder (for devs)
	regenerate daily

script to generate min-build

howto build neomutt page
	simple instructions
	expert instructions
	explain all build scripts, etc
	location of source / repo
	howto install
	distro pre-built installs

NeoMutt website top tips?

[management]/bin
	sync.sh 6h cron script to sync mirrors
	sync needs ssh key
		external to script
		(document in header)
	sync reads data file with header, whitespace & comments

sample mail repo filled with example/problem mailboxes

delegation of keys -> focus() -> parent -> global, e.g. IW, Mail
	functions => components (e.g. mail)     }- mail_init() register_functions(); register_commands();
	commands => components                  }

show focus -- sacrifice help line?
	no, it's not always visible
propagation of notifications -- start @focus, work down
	SB, IW, PW + 'q' mail accepts, hides PW, PS, focus IW
	SB, IW + 'q' mail notified, rejects, global accepts, closes app
Help starts @focus, Panel Name + get_keys method
if sidebar is a separate panel and src file, should IW be?  PW?  AI?
If focus is on PW and SB, IW, PW are siblings, how can SB get notifications?
	or does mail Panel catch and iterate through children?
	SB mappings are (index,pager) => behaviour wanted but not in AW

panels have dividers enum
	left
	right
	top
	bottom
	between
	outside
who owns the dividers space?
set_focus (panel)
	who owns the focus?
	gfx(curses)?
	get_char -> gfx_get_char -> consider focus
on close panel, focus moves to
	*prev*/next sibling, or parent?
	due to mutt's UI focus moves to prev sibling
how can I show focus without moving anything? i.e. borders
	sacrifice a top line?
	border highlight?  => always present
which panels *accept* focus?
	sidebar
	index window
	pager window
	<tab> to switch?
	or <left>, <right>?

website: some bug-fixes have gone away -> success page?

âˆ€ new bugfixes -- reference trac number in commit message
test email reply to issues, etc
	markdown?

get travis to build RPMs on neomutt and deploy to github release's artifacts automatically
website front page: do YOU have a mutt patch? -> contact us
website collection of changes since last release -> relnotes on release
	note which branches, etc
website highlight section on toolbar (solid colour?)

new hierarchy: tree => mail's parent is folder or mail

icons for news:
	news: newspaper
	devel: jigsaw, spanner&screwdriver
	release: present, balloons

use links(1) as a model for re-architecting mutt
	mouse control (inc right-click)
	safe html rendering
	pop-up windows
or mc (midnight commander)

update website gh page: list of branches
neomutt FAQ -- containing what?
add my gpg signing key to neo.org, fc.org

fmemopen - merge into one place in mutt_mktemp()?
	idea from dgc email
	do all the callers know the file size?

Do drafts *need* to be stored in a separate folder?
	why not inline?
	in threaded order
	just tagged or coloured
	status flag to denote draft

screenshots on website
neomutt version on website home page

doc travis and coverity options
split source?
	tools/ - standalone exes
	library/ - replacement library functions
	readme/ - obvious

save email doesn't respect the umask

kdave - limit-current-thread
	alt-l (show limit) should respond "limit thread"
	is "limit ." the same as "limit all" -- YES
		fixed internally
	create unlimit patch and pull-request for kdave?
	limit doesn't have any context, just a pattern
	limit-current-thread NEEDS to know current email
	it'd be nice to change limit to accept another "string" arg
	currently
		"all" -> "~A"
	change limit
		"thread" -> "~a" (only letter available)
		let general limit machinery do the work
	unfortunately they can't see the current email
	use context, or change prototypes

vim library of config options(vars)
	auto-extract from mutt_config.c

kill version.c:rstrip_in_place()
	fix external build scripts

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside area of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

cond-date needs some concrete examples

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

community script check for update
	date community docs?
	or just rely on commit date?

replace " with ' in muttrc

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

docs/muttrc/readme/mutt_config.c
	need to document default values for variables

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

git
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares
	gperf to generate perfect hashes

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

keep revision number for all config items (as a prelude to proper notifications)
	only increment revision number on change
	leads to possible A-B-A problem (change blindness)
	if (ver(format_str) > old_ver) STMT;
	allows code to make informed decisions about caching

which config items require frequent and costly interpretation?
	all format strings -- every line, every refresh

data source LDAP
	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistent undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

integrate nntp into sidebar
what does notmuch return?
	how do i link it to existing objects?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate EMAILs
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

postpone patch doesn't quite work
	1) The PostContext and menu are private, so sidebar can't tell that
	   we're looking at the postponed list after navigation.
	2) After navigating to another folder, you still have to "quit" to
	   get the display to refresh.

alternative to lightweight patch
	don't update info âˆ€ EMAILs
	just update the current page
	only update lists when the user OPENs a folder
	not when they move the highlight
	could pre-emptively populate the previous/next pages

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
break up mutt_config.c, globals.h, functions.h
	mutt_config.c option DELEGATE, prefix "sidebar_", callback?
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, email.c, mh.c
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
separate modules -- sidebar, index, pager, help? -- each with
	init()
	notify()
	close()
	config()
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

Unmailbox * â‡’  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

Start; Incoming; Inbox open; current = Incoming; sort â†’ cur is offscreen, boundaries lost

Notify (Box*, Rect old, Rect new, flags)
Flags:
	too small to render
	changed visibility

Changed posn notification ONLY
	e.g. sidebar has swapped sides
could imply that cached data may be OK to reuse
	e.g. don't need to call calc_boundaries

repaint if:
	size changes
	position changes

DBUS plugin -- to do what?
	notify out
	take input to do what?
		accept mailto: links

quiet config option -- don't whine about unknown config options
	or quiet command line option

trim trailing slash from mailboxes, folder
	shouldn't be displayed

New only -- include structure (empty dirs) to keep hierarchy
	mail (0)
	  fruit (0)
	    apple (1)

sorting
	if displaying full paths:
		sort by display name
		sort by underlying name
	if displaying indented paths:
		sort by top-level names, then children

send escape sequence to clear terminal title when mutt closes
mutt_config.c struct option_t needs enums for types and union for data
timer notifications, e.g.
	highlight something for three seconds, then return to normal

wrapping â†’
	extra char at beginning of line "+"
	extra char at end of line "<-/"
wrap at:
	char
	word (whitespace)
	clause (punctuation)
	sentence (.!?)
No wrap â†’
	extra char at end of line ">"
