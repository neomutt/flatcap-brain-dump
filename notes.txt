need to test message_bar() when msg contains 2-cell characters

message_bar() doesn't need mutt_simple_format()
	it already has the screen width
	it just needs to pad using spaces

replace
	get_sort_str() with cs_subset_str_string_get()

test: create code to display every dialog
	how?  some require files!

progress bar
	if message is very long (wider than the screen) it wraps
	but... the progress bar itself is only one row high
	leaving junk above it

#mutt user asks:

`:echo $INTERNAL_VAR` doesn't expand

	   flatcap | same in mutt

actions:
	I haven't seen "working-directory" in the actions before.
	I should probably retro-fit that into some of the other actions

refactor progress_new()
	new takes type, size
	progress_set_message(format, ...)
	printf-style
	saves on having temporary buffer in many of the callers
	can be called to change the message
	new(type) only
	progress_set_size(1234)?

DT_NOT_EMPTY -- not implemented in all config types
	doesn't make sense for numeric types
	should be there for strings / object types

struct Path needs: bool is_local

w0lff:
	I don't know all configuration options for the sidebar but I think the sidebar could have a fresher-upper.
	Like support for the empty/NoSelect folders (with an own color-group for "this is a non-selectable/non-mbox folder", thunderbird displays these
	folders in a darker grey);
	custom hierarchical entries with configurable indent;
	colorization by character spans e.g. highlight the number of unread mails different from the name of the folder;
	or even more advanced multiple custom sidebars, useful for multiple account setups or to give a reduced select view of only a subset of mailboxes.

sidebar tree generator
mxapi.account.get_path_separators()
	mailbox level
	or account level
mxapi.account.get_all_mailboxes()
	get a list of all (subscribed or not)
sidebar_fill_in_the_blanks
	create fake entries to create a coherent tree
sidebar_generate_tree -fill-gaps ~/mail  or  imap://host.com/
	=> limited number of sorting methods
	what happens with hidden mailboxes?

sidebar - when did labels start getting indented?

stackoverflow
	In mutt one copies an email to a mailbox with copy-message, bound to C by default.
	This will ask you for a mailbox to copy it to.
	Is there a way to copy it directly to the mailbox currently highlighted in the sidebar?
we could add mailbox shortcut '$', but how would the code work
index knows about emails, but doesn't know about the sidebar
sidebar knows about the highlight, but doesn't know about emails
perhaps the sidebar could register a shortcut symbol, with a callback function

color link command to share colours
	Need `enum ColorId link;` in AttrColor
	if linked, then changing one colour could affect many others

gahr
	would you change alias_to_addrlist to append to the addrlist param ?
	So you could avoid the temporaries + mutt_addrlist_copy
it's not quite trivial due to `first->personal` and call to mutt_addrlist_to_intl()
that'd get repeated for the entire list

add ASAN notes to github canned responses

Is there any way to capture and refer back to the address captured by 'send2-hook ~t %s' in a backtick command on the right-hand side?
	e.g. ~t "jim@host.com"  ->  set varible = "\1"  (meaning jim@host.com)
	hmm... not easily, because we'd have to de-construct the pattern
	"~t jim@example.com" is easy enough, but what about "~t jim | ~t bob"
	hmm... if the pattern-matching code were able to tell the caller _which_ part of the pattern matched
	patterns are only ever matched against one type of object, but we wouldn't be able to tell which field
	mutt_pattern_exec() would return: MUTT_PAT_TO, "jim@example.com"

	need upstreams fix b48f8e1e

visual glitch at time of sending mail?
	sidebar always gets updated and refreshed ahead of other windows!

make mail_check_stats default to YES?
	most people will want it

ideas for REALLY deeply nested emails:
	The number of replies is much more than 100
	1) In index view center subject if message is under cursor.
	2) Limit the maximal offset of discussions in index view.

make all notification objects const?
	possible?

rename op_XYZ() functions to fn_&?
	probably no, but need to de-dupe them

file browser, add (toggle-able) live preview window
	mailcap the current selection into the window
	need focus control or duplicate set of motion functions

guideline for mutt_{message,warning,error}
	would you want the message to interrupt a macro running?
	mutt_error() => stop macro?
	mutt_warning() => print/queue during macro?
	mutt_message() => ignore during macro?
	option to ignore erros duing macro run?

is there a security? reason that we don't log all gpg commands?
	all the gpg commands go through: ncrypt/pgpinvoke.c:226

mutt_query_exit()
	on Ctrl-C, Y, don't exit(1)
	set a global that causes the dialog stack to collapse?
	potentially allow the backends to close down gracefully

color command doesn't update pager!
	`color header fg bg .`
	it would mean re-rendering the email to re-embed the colour codes
	setting SigWinch=1 forces the issue

reduce CI cost:
	only run most test for test/NAME branches

colours:
	add flags to definitions?  TAKES_REGEX?
	add callback parse function?

struct Email: adding notify changed the struct
	check hcache version is diff for release

docs: add page describing all config types
	including all flags (subtypes)

nntp: allow sub/unsub in index/pager

coverage: check dev analysis docs for new 'coverage' dir

<thread><function>, <subthread> to act without tagging
	like <tag-prefix>, add "-prefix" to above?

nntp docs:
	document '?' on screen to browse after 'i'

config parsing revamp
	track stack of files 'source'd
	track line numbers
	batch mode flag -> do nothing for gui config like 'color'
	cache locations of config
		like vim's `:verbose set x`
	need framework to delegate parsing

add stats page:
	email stats about one email?
		size, headers, etc?
	mailbox stats
		num emails, num uniq addr/recipients, size
	click on num addrs for *list* of addrs
		user can act on list: email, alias, etc
	stats on all mailboxes, number, size
	email stats across all mailboxes?
	try to limit info to that in header cache for speed

Live log message window (for devs?)
	magic height
	shown when several messages arrive in 1s => show all
	Ctrl-L clear
	list for logging (needs notify)
	follow log, always at end (no user interaction?)
	top-level window.  where?
		side -> narrow
		bottom -> short
	page up/down could cause more logging!
	simple interactions would have to be log free

add dev docs for all --debug/--devel configure options
	link to docs from ./configure --help

in future with external event loop,
	macros can be executed in one go, without refreshes
	currently the keys get put into the buffer
	then the index/pager/etc executes them individually
	perhaps the user *wants* to see feedback for the macro?
	-> <silent> (<verbose>) surrounds
	end of macro -> !<silent>
	nested macros will depend on if <verbose> were used in any
	(cf vim lazyredraw, :silent)

behaviour on multiple error messages?
	stop action on first?
	tell use to read <show-log-messages>
	or a counter "error... (+2)"
	or 1 sec timeout & queue

why no <tag-pattern> in alias dlg?

event scripting
	<gahr> I want an integration with a scripting language
	<jindraj> lua?
	<gahr> and the integration is event driven
	<gahr> jindraj: I don't care too much
	<flatcap> who are you?  and what have you done with gahr?
	<gahr> so neomutt issues events like key_pressed, or message_opened
	<gahr> and those functions are implemented in a script and can call to neomutt commands
	<flatcap> that would be very nice...
	<gahr> key_pressed(key) { if (key == 'a') { neomutt::open_folder('imaps://....') }
	<flatcap> but I'm damned if I know how you'll do it!
	<gahr> you'd get rid of macros, folder-hooks, everything
	<gahr> just events
	<flatcap> one of my reasons for refactoring the dialogs is as preparation for moving the main event loop...
	<flatcap> i'd like one getch() in main() that distributes events to the "focussed window" (or wherever)
	<flatcap> it would also include timers (so we can get rid of the imap code in the getch())
	<flatcap> delegating events to a script would be simple

focus in/out. useful?
	https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/480138/417458
	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html
	There's a FocusIn/FocusOut mode. To enable:
		echo -ne '\e[?1004h'
	To disable:
		echo -ne '\e[?1004l'
	On each focus event, you receive either \e[I (in) or \e[O (out) from the input stream.

(un)focus-hook
	change check_stats timings!

allow <limit> in the pager, so the user can
	<limit><enter> to refresh the index

*live* limit (config option?)
	limit is reapplied after any action
	`~N` limit: emails disappear after reading (e.g. in Pager)

<jindraj>
	I know about one case when tag prefix doesn't work.
	When you use internal pager and have pager_index_lines set to some positive number.
	Tag multiple messages, open any message, then tag prefix doesn't work, all actions are applied only to a opened message.
	It may be misleading because you can see the messages tagged.
<tag-prefix> isn't implemented for the pager
	should it be?

on mailbox_sync()
	does the frontend *know* what's changed?
	should sync() be given a subset of E?

searching: pattern expansion using simple_search
	`apple` will be expanded using $simple_search

delegate Config object to NeoMutt (don't free it separately)
NV NeoMuttView => ndata & free_ndata - wrap gui globals

∀ types
∀ levels N|A|M
∀ (name|HE)
∀ (get|set)
∀ (native|string)

level	HE
N	* --> Global
	^
	|
A	* (value)
	^
	|
M	* (value)

lookups with missing HE -> string
manipulations to generate scope, etc
lookup on unchanged M mean 2 redirects
if M-value is looked at *once*, it's likely to be again
	so always generate

N-sub or Globals ∀ code?
	N-sub where possible
	then convert to (scope-)-sub later

create_inheritance needs to honour INH_ACC|INH_MBOX
if config *can't* be inherited, will all lookups be inefficient?  probably
or drop flags - inherit anything, code will decide N|A|M
NO. need flags to warn user (flags to match code)
inherit where A-sub or M-sub are used
need flags for config dump (add to :set output)
does INH_MBOX imply INH_ACC?  probably
	specify both for clarity?  YES
need to categorise all Config
	NONE (global)
	Account-specific
	Mailbox-specific
	447 config variables
:set -h (help) other options for dump flags, including inheritance

mutt_config.c, config def
	convert comment to markdown *string*
	support: bold, italic, paragraphs, lists, tables
config dump option to display in various formats
	markdown (unprocessed)
	text
	highlighted-text
	nroff
	docbook
fix doc build

create_inheritance
	N-, A, M-sub missing name
degenerate !sub, or !name -- fail
simple name exists return HE
A-sub, parent -->  N-sub exists, create A:name
M-sub, parent --> A-sub, parent --> N-sub exists, create A:name, create M:name

Pass sub to dialogs -- their config scope
What if dlg needs some A- and some M-specific config?
Dlg given M-sub, searching for A-limited config will cause M-inherit!
All gui-config is global -- initially
All index/page config is M-specific, compose too
Alias/query is global
Who checks config setting?  parse_set?  validator?
	magic validator ∀ config to check inheritance?
Add *sub* to dlg, get_config_scope(dlg)?
	change varname from sub to "cfg"
After docs split, break up / comment config lists by N|A|M scope?

{imap,pop,smtp,nntp}_port config?  only settable by URL!
timeouts on variables (for passwords)?
	require all accesses to be through cs/sub
libsend around smtp.c send.c sendlib.c
sort_re docs wrong

help backend
	if neomutt started with zero mailboxes, load help
	first email says "Welcome to NeoMutt, press <enter> to continue"
	use localised version of email where available
	then vim-tutor like

Account observes config
{user,pass,login} -> set_X
url change -> wipe settings, set all

need service name "imap", etc
globals - need to parameterise:
	$tunnel
	$preconnect
	$use_ipv6
	$connect_timeout

ConfigAccount - cached credentials (rename?)
if (!has_X) get(X)
	function callback to Account

mx_open -> imap_open -> socket -> sasl (missing creds) -> connect
	sasl needs to ask user for info
	ssl/tls need to validate certificates

missing credentials (before connect) - has to happen here
	*sasl* might ask questions
	accept/reject cert (mid-connect)
		pass in response for testing purposes?
	NO have special version of libquestion

magic pager bar too
create index/pager macros that save/restore
	pager_index_lines
	sidebar_visible
	pager_format
	save to myvars
	if ifdef to only need one macro?

M.verbose for messages -> notification?
	let UI decide if quiet or not

main - folder-hook is called before startup-hook
	should it?

pop_fetch_mail()
	move spoolfile, $folder out of pop/

ConnAccount needs method to *push* data
	e.g. ask for a password, then Account saves to config

lots of sidebar settings apply to the browser
	should be account display settings!

folder format needs 'subscribed' flag/field

:changelog ?
	read from /usr/share/doc/neomutt
	:news ?
	:credits
	:about

auto.def
	list devel features, e.g. magic bars
	add disclaimer

desktop stuff (mailto, icon)
	contrib
	web contrib
	mailing lists
	twitter

backends need splitting
	UI stuff vs pure code (only dep libmutt etc)
	good for asking questions too
	"pop/gui.c" all the wrappers

Add Imap seq letter/fd to all logs?
	need imap_debug() macro

Document Imap compression to user ml (etc)

change imap_error to use macro and MuttLogger correctly
	or eliminate it!  no gettext, uses function names!

backend/path.c ∀ type

loglevel for data (imap) showing '\n'?

mutt_inbox_cmp() called by
	browser, sidebar

use startup notification to imap_login()?
	parse config
	"mailboxes" -> A,M generation
what if INBOX isn't subscribed?
	what happens to empty '/' Mailbox?
	Kept -- it was "mailboxes" after all
After config, have A-M tree
	Imap listens for STARTUP
startup:
	startup-notification
	startup-hook
	folder-hook
	open folder
imap uses notify to login ∀ A
	login -> LSUB -> mailboxes
startup-hook
	allows user to make post-config changes / commands
folder-hook
	allows user to make folder-specific changes
open folder

$folder should be tidied on setting - strip trailing slash
probe
	if local dir, squash ../ etc
	imap, trailing / (need Account)
who does the tidying?  when?
	validator/fixer?
	or observer?  NO
		observer -> user set, notify, fixer set, notify!

split buffer_expand/resolve into PATH functions and MAILBOX functions!

config: change sort to work like enum -- use Data field
	except allow magic "reverse-", "last-" prefixes

create mailbox (browser)
	errors on empty -- kill error
	rename, delete too?

{backend}/hcache.c?
	no, hcache shouldn't be in backends

change OP_X to exactly match function name?

split up MxOps?
	have backends register their functions?

split mx.c mx_{ac,mbox,msg,path,tags}.c

{backend}/{ac,mbox,msg,path,tags}.c ∀

Distinguish all IMAP logging by its connection details
	create imap_debug() macro
	add prefix field to log_dispatcher_t
	all the functions using mutt_debug() need an adata param/local
	use prefix of [seqid/fd]

new sort option to sort flagged emails first
	include entire thread?

have HomeDir, create CurrentDir for cwd?
	it doesn't change

named mailboxes - check "name" is unique across *A*
compare local fs using dev id, inode id
test ("prefix/%s/suffix", path)
HomeDir, CurrentDir _const_ char *
fix test names: test_pop_path2 -> test_path2_pop
Have HomeDir, create CurrentDir for cwd?
	it doesn't change (yet)

A is global, outside of parse(M, a, etc) so
split parse? for imap to use?  where is A subst?
M-fn(M-str, A (optional)), parse uses stack. imap uses A-self
M-str is de-escaped, de-quoted
parse M is A-stack-aware, get str, get stack A
M-fn() if A A->sub else N->sub.  lookup $folder
	resolve (M-str) -> P; find (P) -> M or ac_add(M) on A
	or new A, ac_add(M), or fail

rename mbox - what happens to hcache?
	what happens currently with IMAP? - lost? unreachable
	NOTHING

issue template -> folding section + ``` ?
mutt_date_localtime_l (with C locale?)
bug: HOME=/ neomutt -d6 crashes on startup - fopen failed
define LL_CONFIG even if it's only 5
config logging level, file,rc ':cmd', acc, mailboxes, stack?
test case for saving to a symlinks -> real mustn't overwrite symlink!
test realloc(0), rather than code exception!
cron: check all msg/error for gettext
change #ifdef else -> #ifdef/endif #ifdef/endif for testing both paths?

use mbox driver to open orphan maildir file R/O?  NO, maildir
release check everything with, without pgkconf
doc release-test.sh, shellcheck it
shellcheck hcachever.sh and test output for various releases
mailboxes -spacer "free form string" ?
change twitter to *my* email - access to others?  how?
change_folder_next broken?
https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/contribute !!!

'force' flag for recalc(), repaint()?
	ctrl-l => reflow *all*, recalc *all*, repaint *all*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sidebar folding
fold_level
	fold at account only
	fold at any nested Mailbox
exceptions for New, Flagged emails, current Mailbox
Highlight on Account expands all M
	move down to A, highlight on
	move up from next A, highlight on A's last M!

Sorting
	Mailboxes only by N or count, etc
	Inc A => sort *within* A by N or count, etc

Colour for A, e.g. red + underline
Expandos for
	A: type IMAP, host, user, port, desc
	folded mailboxes: num M, total N, total F, total E, total O, total R, etc
	subscribed expando "*" vs space
	<toggle-subscribed> to view all M
	$sb_show_all?
	<subscribe>/<unsubscribe> to mailboxes/unmailboxes
	<next-sibling>(prev) <parent-folder>
	expandos for *totals* or automagic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

capitalise Autocrypt: code, docs, trans
alias - recent queries as sidebar entries
popup windows - dim(grey) all colours of other windows (how?)
alias tag == groups?
makefile autosetup folding

emails[] split - stepping stone
	backend keeps private array
	notifies to another part of self to update frontent array
	frontend behaves as normal during transition

memory usage
	where's it all going?
	need tree of objects
	visitor sizeof()!
	:memory command
	--debug-memory

create more easy tasks (investigate)
	pin issue

tabs for accounts - steal space from helpbar (if visible)
	on left?
	on right?
tab name needs format string for "*" notifications
preset, coloured blobs?

for popup windows, or non-focussed, *dim* other windows
	want to preserve indicator presence
	color dim_{text,indicator,bar}
	if unset, don't dim?
	or generate defaults?
	need 3 or 4 indicator colours {focus,dim}_{indicator,highlight}
	sidebar _does_ show dim_highlight

screenshots
	svg - fake sidebar divider line?
	termtosvg - hide cursor

:verbose set/color/etc
	like vim
	save location of last setting of var
	config, cli, etc
	show when/who last set that variable/color/etc
	debug/devel only?

"mailboxes -folded X"
"mailboxes -recurse X"
	how would the sidebar/maildir declare/process the option?

Window observer WIN_DELETE as d'tor!

cli text mode option - sets $ascii_chars
	how can we do this automatically?

docs: two types of dialog: pager, index
	plus passive windows

use `ifdef` to test if file exists?
	syntax?
	new command instead?
	or <silent> option?

off-by-one pager_index_lines doesn't include ibar
sidebar will become the same when divider is in a separate window!
what about users that share config between old/new neomutt (or upstream mutt)?

merge gfx/arch diagrams into doxygen docs?
	where?  how?
	link from dev page

Config
	rather than C_X = val; fn(); C_X = oldval
	create tmp *subset* with that one value changed!
	isolates change from other code/readers/threads!
	will that work?
	if A:M:Cfg and set plain Cfg?
	if unnamed subset, will normal inheritance still work?

"builtin" lots of refs left in docs/code
	validator warning?

flatcap/flatcap/README.md!

man validate: mandoc -Tlint file.1

attach_abort, macos, use ENHANCED symbol?

<f1> help
<f2> web help, use mailcap!
ConfigDef
	help section=href
	varname = #offset!

have *Window* cache text/attrs?
	repaint itself?
	unless (calc?)
	might lead to multiple paintings

docs for log vim syntax, conceallevel=2

folded struct in C is private 'o' symbol
	comment for folded function

universal docs - all text and SVG

validator contract?
	what's expected for each config type?

validator need to pass *var* especially if inherited

attach list expando for boundary param, how?

audit imap untagged commands before authentication

test build all db store combinations + pkgconf!  ~512

make store TESTCASE (lmdb)

devel/noconfig (or globals)
	var = &cdef->var !
	+ flag, (assert NULL)

const ∀ graphviz functions

sb/preview insertion: observe AllDialogs
	rather than NeoMutt, for reduced noise

progress bar to status bar expando?
	how to disable normal display?

index what do the functions apply to?
	sb, mbox, email, notmuch, index

test: check that test_X() provides 100% coverage of X()
	and other test functions aren't required, ∀X

index "preview" panel
	sort of "opposite" of index_pager_lines (focus on pager)
	option to *not* read email (or default)

add space into API headers, code style too - blank line

review upstream sed scripts

test files need to be non-symlinked dir. doc this

debug
	move win_name to common?

error message
	options %s may not...
	underline %s for emphasis.  how?
	printf("%s", decorate(param))
		not possible without static buffer

array of components to X_init(), X_shutdown()

cumulative expandos for threads, etc
	%x, %Cx
	%b, %Cb

config
	cdef: name, &var, initial
	type my_var delegates to String
		implements +=, -=
	subset name "", !parent
	scope MYVAR
	cs_inherit_variable(cs, NULL, "my_var")
	always store as string
	merge create_synonym and inherit variable?

enable -Wextra ?
	how much noise?  quite a bit
	183 signed-ness
	306 unused param
	  9 missing field (PrexStorage)
	 12 missing field ConnAccount

20:34 <Raid-1> Yes, adding "deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian testing main" to my sources.list worked like a charm.

iconv
	drop PreferredMimeNames
	check all charset names strictly using iconv
	have deprecation period where we tell the user what to use instead

command/function to display current ssl cert info
	for current account
	add to :show-account command
	account credentials (or ***)
	hostname
	certificate
	account-specific config

expose *read-only* config variables for
	cwd, current A/M/E . name/path/etc?

imap mailbox comments/descriptions
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5464
	https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/imap_metadata/
	CAPA: METADATA

tweak maildir backend to allow opening a single file
	fake mailbox, 1 email, read-only

header and msgcache use different dirs!
	imaps:flatcap-mail@flatcap.org
	imaps_flatcap-mail_flatcap.org

bug: after being prompted for an smtp password, it's not cached in C_SmtpPass

change myvars to use NT_MYVAR in Config
	allow A-, M-scoping?

sidebar announce behavioural changes (user-ml, website news) link to twitter, irc

":seta" == ":account set" ?
":setm" == ":mailbox set" ?

after release check acutest, autosetup for new releases

analysis-compiler - list all my gcc flags

more test builds with deployment
	scan-build
	cppcheck
	lcov - deploy to website repos
	link in from analysis pages
	repos have README.md - which has priority on main website?
	put content in analysis/ for scoping
	test dupes and scoping

web: add GH release notes emojis to web top-level menus?

put header cache structs in separate *minimal* header files

shellcheck on hcachever.sh

struct Pager -> PagerInfo?

move file deletion out of page
	which callers can be fixed?

help_line_format - put custom text at the top
	tie in with account-hooks, macros, etc
	for reminders, etc

mutt_sort_headers actually sorted Emails

status bar idea:
	empty status_format -> do not draw
	using conditional expandos that evaluate to an empty string -> do not draw

debug refresh idea: use greyscale background
	increment each repaint
	need to combine colours
	would need bitfield or flag (changed & visible) on Mailboxes
	or each window has a repaint count
		need way to reset occasionally
		Ctrl-L?

add 'sleep' command
	useful for macros
	allow fractional seconds

easy: mxapi: mbox_create/delete()
then add to browser, need exists fn too

mxapi open_append - move create? query to neo
backend->does_mailbox_exist()
	no, query user
	be->create_mailbox() OK
	be->open_mailbox()

Mailbox, Email - rearrange members: pure data first, connecting pointers,
	see #1870
	private data, last view data - move into inline View struct?
	move into external view struct?
	func data is from file/server - no config required, no globals
	use hcache as guide to purity of data
	Email shrinks from 192 bytes to 32
	Body shrinks from 176 bytes to 24
	Envelope is 344 bytes

no such mailbox -> link to docs
	fake mailboxes

project "next release"
	rename to "2019-MM-DD" after release
	notes, triage, todo, done

split up management repo?

pager <change-folder>?<enter>q goes back to pager

log macro actions carefully

log all hooks

config: can't un*set* enum!

postponed docs don't contain the work "draft"!

post-send hook for doing stuff

M must exist
	what about "sent" or "trash" folders?  which might not
	option to create (silently) missing Mailboxes?
	could be messy

cli(debug) mailbox dump, print index to screen width formatted
	coloured, batch mode, retval like -z, -Z
	or just dump *new* mail
	multiple mailboxes too, separated by M's path?
	json/xml output?
	eventually split into separate app using libmutt, etc
	use getopt_long -- all platforms >10y

Feature: when entering a field, print errors on the line above
	alternaively, *insert* entry field below message window
	it's empty and invsible unless used!
	could use for completion matches too

mutt_buffer_mktemp() ought to live in muttlib! because of config etc
	buffer.c should have no dependencies (except memory, string)

config validators - allow to change value, clamp, ignore "builtin"

eliminate config.h ∀ .h (29) start with libs

Narrow sidebar idea, when width = 1 (or 2)
	abbreviate to single letter
	use colour to show new (or icon)
	position gives you a clue where new mail is
	width=1 no divider, use bg colour to distinguish from index/pager

rename var tmpfile (it's a libc fn)

which commands *might* have observers?
	sidebar fns don't know about/if there's a sidebar!

command events, pass Commands[] index, no other data needed

ACS_VLINE(sb) -> create primitives draw_line(), draw_box()!

Config (accept-disabled-config)
	enable by default
	allow distros to disable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

init base windows main()
(compartmentalised world)
index creates dialog - tree, diagram
dialog has data (state including current Mailbox)
sidebar init -> window
	sb_init(dlg) -> inserts itself
	show data tree to A->M

Index <sb-open> -> sb_fn(open) -> dlg.set_current(M) - index processes
	send notify M changed (sb listens -> need recalc)
Index calls reflow/repaint on dlg, sg reacts, repaints.  Done

On window drag resize, when are recalc/repaints done?
Drag (horizontal) -> SIGWINCH -> reflow root -> *some* windows notify size
(sb no action), (index need recalc), repaint root, skip sb, repaint index DONE
Drag (vertical) (helpbar no change), others repaint

Index->find(ID_SIDEBAR) in dlg, call sb(win, x, y, z)
sb->find(ID_INDEX) in dlg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

idea: magic wrap - regex to ignore wrapping for URLs etc
	or $no_wrap_split

lower case attrset not wrapped!

docs: check paths are correct
	/usr/share/docs/sample

debug-only MARKER logging ∀ colour code paths
	all valid, all error, all dupes, all uncolor non-existent
	if not markers, comments ∀
	LL_MARKER (#ifdef DEBUG) level7 just for testing?

how many ways are there to reply?
	how many config vars/lots affect reply?
	alternates, aliases, bounce, reply-to:, etc
	flowchart?  too complicated?

allow "uncolor obj" for normal objects -> default default (no attrs)
	+ attach_headers, status, uncolor needs retval

libgui - new logging level?

wrap ColorQuote array, get_quote_color(n)?
use ifndef in /etc/neomuttrc to disable *some* defaults
	colours, bindings

challenge - preserve order of tagged emails, so that
	copy/save occurs in the proscribed order
- need to add to EL_tagged as it happens
- maildir (dest) needs to tweak timestamps to ensure order
  (or save to mbox instead)
tweaking can't happen in backend -- it only sees one file at a time
need MXAPI for fast copy for when src & dst backends are the same
change maildir to use (save to) timestamp, if set (NOW, if not)
saving emails to IMAP, what are files in underlying maildir?
	files timestampted for most recent (topmost)
	received timestamp
mx_msg_open_new(), mutt_safe_message()
maildir_msg_open_new(), md_commit_message()

BUG: hooks not run on initial "mailboxes" command, but are later

LEAK: buffer pool, alias groups (not *owned*)

BUG: "set charset" should call mutt_ch_set_charset()

CHECK: other NOT_EMPTY config isn't emptied by reset

GH Label has:workaround

VERIFY: no leaks, no UB, ∀ startup pats
CHECK: -T output (drop or #ifdef)

in:  echo `sleep 10 &`
	ampersand isn't honoured
	problem upstream too
	it IS in honoured elsewhere

fopen ∀ log path & fd
	log fd on close
	macro to get FILE, LINE, FUNCTION
	err Buffer too?
	need flags for perms

symlinks
	when should symlinks be resolved?
	should neomutt show the resolved or unresolved path?

attach_save_dir config
	DT_*DIR* must be dir or non-existent
	stop trailing '/'
	if exists, warn if not writeable
	warn if non-dir
	hmm... default is "./" -> "."
	DT_FILE, no trailing '/'
		if exists, writeable
		or non-existent

endwin(); printf(); refresh()
	makes output go to 'normal' screen
		can be coloured!
	NO flicker
	save the output of ALL commands
	and log it twice: to LOG and normal screen

tag emails, then save|copy -- no progress

shrink 'code' repo, or replace empty and restart
	exclude from mirroring

:toggle abc<tab>
	should it only complete to booleans/quads? etc

context sensitive help
	use index selection
	e.g. mailing list specific
	index help should be backend-specific

mail_check_stats(_interval) -- A-specific
	use *un*folder-hook to have different settings for
	current and 'other' accounts

log_disp_debug_terminal
	*everything* to stdout

notify_remove() needs data for exact match

<quiet> option for <pipe-message> and <shell-escape>
	logs output raw to neomutt debug log
	mutt_error() if it fails

feature: live filter index as you type, cf sidebar matcher
	fuzzy?

neo maildir header/message cache
	auto-add README.md, saying
	"auto-generated"
	"safe to delete anything"
	list settings for the cache

like lkml backend, run notmuch on IMAP as background task
	select Account/Mailboxes you want to index
	work backwards from NOW
	apply to new mail
	unapply to deleted mail (or tag)
	unapply to trashed mail (or tag)
	implies notmuch is a transparent layer over backend
		for maildir, imap, lkml, nntp
	need rules to cull old entries
	might need separate databases
	better as an external prog?
	notmuch layer listens for new-mail, del-mail notifications, etc

create sample code for inline and out-of-line STAILQ use and others
	where to put it
	use apple and banana gist
	https://gist.github.com/flatcap/105cd65e37d89fc434b2b632e85c3702
	add diagrams
	list users (or helper classes)

change "hidden_tags" to be a regex? (#1744)
	backwards-compatible how?
	look for '(' ')' '*' '|' ?
	how do we store it in Config if it has two possible types?

tmp *dir* per email
	mostly unused? NO
	lifetime of email
	save attachments in it

newbie question
	how does mail get into neomutt
	What's an MUA?

<f1> for context sensitive help
	<f2> for help on last error received?
	create functions

dump-config
	INDENT option for A-,M-specific

dump-config SHOW_DOCS option
	if $xyx is inherited, then show and document the base value
	don't doc inherited value
	if base value isn't changed from default, comment it out

deferred config evaluation
	automatic for sensitive variables?
	global contains `script.sh` get_value() evaluates the backticks
	can't be done by config system, only outside can eval ``s
	need to be careful to avoid double evaluation
	don't want backends evaluating ``s either (transparent)

core lib
	NeoMutt, Config, Account, Mailbox, Notify
	can it be made independent?
		need to de-gui Email, etc
	core depends on mutt,address,email libs
	config depends on mutt,address,core libs
	backends will depend on mutt,config,email,address,core
		plus ncrypt,conn

docs: "Since: YYYY-MM-DD (or version)"
	drop after 1 year

mutt_get_name() shouldn't be in sort.c
	NO, it's used

embedded editor
	how?  pty's cf screen/tmux
	can screen/tmux nest?

merge/collate email generator scripts

reduce all branches
how much debug code's acceptable?
	dump text
	dump dot visitors
	TAILQ conversions
	summary
	help --devel-help (backend)

run coverity with idn2, openssl, slang

equivalence for `$a_b` and `$a-b` (underscore, dash, none)
	what about `$ab` ?
	for read/write/completion?
	possible?

fix awful code
	fix_uid()
	assignment `buf[n] = 0` in middle of `if` clause
	else if ((n >= 0) && ((ob - buf) == n) && (buf[n] = 0, (strlen(buf) < (size_t) n)))

after:
	split of name:function:description
	windows with focus
	keybindings with timeout
	split of <sidebar-next> constants to SIDEBAR | NEXT
feature:
	create prefix commands
	<sidebar-open> becomes <sidebar><open>
	same for <thread>, <subthread>
		<limit-current-thread> -> <thread><limit>
	would this break the `bind` command?
		or allow an exception for <prefix> + <function>?

different lists for different jobs?
	email/email.h defines `struct Email`
	Index needs an EmailViewList of EmailViewNode (for gui stuff)
	Notifications needs an EmailNotifyList of EmailNotifyNode (for diff notify types)

context-sensitive help should work ∀ prompts,
	e.g. 's' to save email, default location comes up,
	<f1> opens page about saving and the 'save-hook'

what are the dependencies of all the init.c parse functions?
	mutt_extract_token()
	what else?
	can they be isolated, so we can test config parsing?

rerun uncrustify on new code for ()s

move Buffer functions to separate file?
	file.c
	file-buf.c
	separate out deps
	sketch diagram to check if it's worth it

unknown keys elicit error
	how about after 'bind noop'?

could Buffer.data become const
	-> mutt_b2s -> (const char *) cast

user question:
	is there a way to protect an email from the 'd' delete command?
	$flag_safe

set of fake variables $THIS or $THIS_EMAIL
	representing the current email
		what about multiple tags?
	current selection: search of limit, e.g. ~f $THIS.from
	what about multiple addresses, e.g. CC:
		`~f $THIS.cc` -> `(~f andy | ~f bert | ~f charlie)`

add an option to remove empty header fields from the email
	when composing with $edit_headers set
	no more "^Bcc: $", etc
alternate ways: delete
	autocmd BufRead ~/.cache/mutt/neomutt-* 1,/^$/g/^\v(Reply-To|Bcc): *$/d
hide
	:syntax match hide_header "^\v(cc|bcc|reply-to): *$" containedin=mailHeaderKey

ellipsise long mailbox names in the sidebar
	how?  formatter doesn't know type

3-way split display for index, aliases, pgp key list
	does each need domain-specific config
	{index,pgp,alias}_pager_lines

feature: live filter index as you type, cf sidebar matcher

changing the option strings to the form
	(1a)pple, (2b)anana, (3c)herry
	1(a)pple, 2(b)anana, 3(c)herry
means the translators would be free to reorder the options
and we could eliminate the "abc" letter string
this doesn't look so good
	app1(l)e, bana2(n)a, che3(r)ry
perhaps
	app(1l)e, bana(2n)a, che(3r)ry
or clearer still
	(1:a)pple, (2:b)anana, (3:c)herry
	app(1:l)e, bana(2:n)a, che(3:r)ry
the numbers could even be omitted
if the translated string matches the order of the original
what about purely numbered questions, like crypto algorithms
	msgid "(1) apple, (2) banana, (3) cherry?"
	msgid "(1:1) apple, (3:2) cherry, (2:3) banana?"
	(x:y) x:number for neomutt, y:number for human

list autosetup release/commit hash visibly
	(for downstream packagers)

body.h header.h (and others)
	Change LOFF_T to long in headers
	(doesn't require config.h)

mbox adata.append should use Mailbox.append

Do Mailboxes need an open context
	thin shim over M
	hash instance flags, e.g. append
Do Views deal with M or MI (instance)?
	MI: might need access to flags

use SPDX headers?

segfault - flush log (nec?)
	log "segfault" & flush?

standardise naming "folder" vs "mailbox" ∀ docs

imap browser needs way to mark subscribed folders

with split views might there be multiple focused windows?
	pager1, pagerbar1
	pager2, pagerbar2
	different pagers might mean different Mailboxes
	=> statusbar1, statusbar2
parent window starts with (A,M), displays (index, pager, status) from it

use status bar/pager bar to show focus
	like vim's StatusLine{,NC} highlighting
	what about the sidebar?
	background colour change?  #101010 / #e0e0e0

User-Agent config from bool to expando?

nntp://nntp.lore.kernel.org/org.kernel.vger.linux-kernel

reset screen on segfault?
	useful when debugging
	especially for AddressSanitizer

flags
	missing 'rights' in ImapAccountData Mailbox Smtp

open() on open M does what?  sync()
	can't tear down M, might be other users (views)
	want to force an update, though
all updates - if they fail, try not to change M, just return -1
if conn lost, then fail, errmsg, then ??? reconnect after (timeout) or stop?
	next check_stats_interval, will try to reconnect. YES
	-1 failed => try again
	-99 fatal => stop, user must re-open -> flag?
	no fatal, for now?  make r/o if nec, ret -1
ctx_open() vs ctx_wrap() - keeps +1 refcount on M
	-1 on ctx_free()
	kill open, mbox_open() then wrap

mxapi retval -99 fatal => close and reopen
eliminate mxapi calls in BEs?  helpers?  wrappers?

eliminate context from MXAPI, mx.c -> context.c
	wrappers ctx_open(), etc
	move {mx,mailbox,account}.{c,h} to mx/
	deps mutt, email
fix postpone, trash, etc

all mx_X() functions to mailbox_X()? mx_X() for mxapi only?
	what about wrappers - i.e. most of them?

'Folder' limits the independence of mailbox.c
	limited to parse_mailboxes()?

after release
	priority to bug-fixes, tidying
	after that, help2, contrib (e.g. colourschemes)
	so that others can help us

path_canon
	check that Folder, LastFolder, etc exist before using them
	or, force set them at startup

merge mailbox.c and mx.c?
	now that there aren't any deps
	may need to move parse_(un)mailboxes out
	no? mailbox.c for Mailbox-y things, mx.c for mxapi stuff

RE-opening mailbox
	postpone, trash, edit msg, send message (fcc ^)

	'n' == MBOX, etc

split up opcodes by action and detail (sub-action)
	18:03 <adray> You know how we define virtual-mailboxes as "MUTT_VIRTUAL | MUTT_NAMED". Would it be possible to do the same for opcodes? So instead
		of OP_MAIN_VFOLDER_FROM_QUERY_READONLY, it could be OP_MAIN_VFOLDER_FROM_QUERY | OP_READONLY?
	18:04 <adray> (this also ties into your OP_DELETE code, possible to do OP_ATTACHMENT | OP_DELETE)
	18:06 <flatcap> currently, they're an enumeration
	18:07 <flatcap> I wonder how many combinations would make sense.  how many we'd need to make it pay off
	18:10 <flatcap> hmm... quite a few
	18:10 <flatcap> all the SEARCH_X could become SEARCH | X

command to switch account - multi-selection list?  menu?

change pager for <show-log-messages> to start at end of file

.desktop for nntp:// -> neomutt

factor out the code for command "mailboxes"
	so that imap/nntp don't have to create a string
	"mailboxes QUOTED-NAME" just to have it parsed and de-quoted

create synonym <move-message> for <save-message>?

is smtp a BE?
	write-only mailbox
	auth, connection
	definitely need an smtp *dir* and tidier API for sending
	encapsulate vars in dir

reddit mailbox backend?
	see rtv project (python, curses)

rename storage globals to match the neomutt commands, e.g.
	UserHeader -> MyHdr
	or GlobalListMyHdr?

does tree layout of M -> a dummy root M? ∀ BE? probably
	is "/" the root?
	is "INBOX" the root?
	where does "INBOX" live?
users won't want M under INBOX

sileht/imap LONGSTRING -> PATH_MAX * 7
	comments for MData

how does reply_regex fit into index and replying?

maintain stable numbering in the index
	(mailx does this)
	each email is given a sequential number
	new emails get a higher number
	deleted emails' numbers aren't reused
	what happens if the list is resorted?
		numbers end up randomised!
	what about patterns for message numbers
		ignore missing?
		what about -5,.
		find 5 messages, regardless of number?

	single, double, backtick
		'X', "X", `X`
		'"X"', '`X`', "'X'", "`X`", `'X'`, `"X"`
	triple?  a lot of processing
	what about unicode curly quotes?

no pattern to search by label (or regex)
when checking for new mail, distinguish local from remote (cheap from costly)?
attach style sheet to email - mutt color commands - email-specific

imap A has Config:
	"user" inherited from "imap_user"

how do we test the static functions in the libraries?

one shared colour for ALL static functions
use ctags to generate lists

xdg/neomutt/CONFIG

	cache more information about mailboxes?
	network heartbeat to detect connectivity?

what would be needed to have an 'offline' mode?
	how much extra folder info would we need?
	just keep one copy of the 'last state'
	how much code would need rearranging?
	∀ index items, need availability marker
		which are local?
		Header, Struct, Body, Attachments

imap force body cache on read
	option for offline working

inotify ∀ local mailboxes
	2016-11-16 12:13 <royger>
	flatcap: maybe using some abstraction library, like libfswatch
	(it seems to support kqueue, inotify and fsevents)

collect useful tools in neomutt org:
	urlview
	offlineimap, mbsync

How to Use Mutt doc
	step 1 - select your source
		POP, IMAP, local, offlineimap/alternative

web: misc page for extra options that aren't in features

announce GPLv2 usage for project
	make it clear on the (devel) website

stable branches for LTS releases?
	Why?  Mutt doesn't

code school -> neo branches (regularly rebased)

	date of last contribution

imap supports queries
	"+?query=tab:inbox"

website
	404 is static!

		needs to be ordered
	src code is not a distro, so list it last

enforce real names in git commits?

settings for uncrustify, clang-format
	for current neo code
	for future  neo code

named-mailboxes use Mailbox Shortcut % ?
	%tidy-name

2016-10-25 11:04 <mgedmin>
	pet peeve: when I try to open a gigabyte-sized mbox file with 10,000 messages, I cannot abort that

2016-10-24 20:54 <flip214>
	it would be very nice if switching to an imap folder could be aborted by ctrl-c
	having all headers fetched anew and having to wait for 2 mins, knowing that the wrong folder is being loaded, isn't that nice
	the counter for the headers fetched (N of M) counts up
	Ctrl-C gets ignored

mutt_launcher
	use a pipe to channel log messages back to mutt
	pipe(), fork()
	dup2() to replace stdout,stderr
		=> printf to log
	stdin -> null

pre-cache app?
workflow:
	offlineimap
	notmuch new
	cache-every-file

need to document "missing" keybindings
	^Q ^S flow control
	^O terminal (BSD only)
	2016-10-23 22:16 <Riviera> stty discard undef; mutt
	"stty -ixon" disable Ctrl-Q
	can this be done programmatically by mutt?
	"stty -a" to show settings
	cfmakeraw(3)
	zsh is able to reset terminal configuration after each command with ttyctl -f

issues -- always assign (for later reference)
	fixer/mentor only makes sense for bugs/enhancements
	what about questions?

2016-10-21
13:24 <mgedmin> on ubuntu I think it's best to 'sudo apt-get build-dep mutt' to get all the libraries

make tags -- ignore standalone tools
	needs to ignore #ifdef TEST, too

external testing
	how many external events can we control?
	how many can we simulate?
	via pretend keystrokes
	key, mouse, winch fs, net

need way to repeatably test net failure

imap/pop ∀ devs
	no outgoing
	incoming to user@dev.neomutt.org
	sample emails refreshed nightly
	btrfs de-duped -- cron

	and poorly designed functions

website top-level for scripts
	git submodule?
	like irssi scripts

21:55 svenG "No attachments, cancel sending? ([yes]/no):"  so NOT cancelling the sending.. sends. o_O  double negatives are always so confusing.. :-/

index folding (happens above level of emails)
	fold by option, e.g. day, month
	Wednesday

		mail
	uses extra lines
	saves width

$sort = [prefix-][...]order
	prefix = reverse
	prefix = thread

vim has set vs setlocal
	mutt has accounts as separate entities

	setlocal var => per account

scratch-pad function
	creates a tmp file
	functions can put text in it
	you can view it in the pager

move score from permanent to volatile

macports, is there something I can update automatically at release time?
	cf homebrew

config file accept keybindings using

filter manager
	time limit option -- on holiday!

forgotten-attachments: German example:
	"häng an" won't match over a new line
	strdup regex string, replacing spaces with
		"[ \t\n]+" ???

turn mutt into a random email generator

Need strategy for unrepeatable/too-little-info bugs/crashes

what are our killer features?
	put them on the website writ large

files/dirs are sorted the same way as network folders
	may not make sense

mbsync better than offlineimap?

imap only 'n' messages option
	like $nntp_context

modularise header caching/dbs
	=> needn't use same cache type
	for header / message cache

pager -- sidebar gets updated but not status line / term header

vim-like hls option: persistent across emails

source script|
	pipe -- lookup exact meaning and implications
	works, but can't tell you where an error occurred

context sensitive popup menus
	e.g. index - tag some emails, hit <menu>
	options: copy, save, delete, set flags, reply, etc

check all lists of features are up-to-date
	web, etc

19:32 <mykoserocin> is there a way to show condensed DKIM results instead of full "Authentication-Details" header?
19:32 <mykoserocin> e.g. "DKIM: pass" or "DKIM: fail"
19:52 <brendan> mykoserocin, I use the spam marker system for it: spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=pass" "✓"
19:52 <brendan> spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=fail" "x"

$source_dir like folder
	or like $PATH?
	looking for files to source

browser - add flagged
	expando
	sort option

copying a large mailbox / number of files doesn't trigger the progress bar
	mbox-100000
	tag all
	copy to another mailbox, e.g. maildir

Passing $VARs to children processes, means
	tell vim about mail rcpt, subject, etc

upstream bug -- folder_format, sidebar_format %n (has new mail)
	shouldn't be cleared if "mark_old = no"
	quit and restart mutt and the flag comes back

	neomutt.org
	github? where?

web update about.html : done so far

fmemopen -- when fixed, default to off

automate github release
	tag, push, create release, push, assets, checksum

dbus - also implies
	synchronisation of multiple copies of mutt
	e.g. multiple windows/views

jump to previous folder command?
	"cd -"
	vim: "ctrl-^"
	can this be done with a folder hook?
	set my_olddir = dir
	is it too late when we get the hook?

"bind index ` command"
	parses badly
	doesn't warn the user

github issue notifications forward to IRC
	or dev mailing list

context-sensitive help?
	how?
	sensitive to what?
	how about:

compress flickers, but gpg doesn't
	imagination, or not?
	option to NOT leave alt-screen mode

lots of demo configs for
	index_format

2016-08-12
	08:31 <flip214> Hi. Another thing I would love to see: an email arrives in INBOX; I answer it,
		and define the FCC for the sent mail, but the incoming mail is still in INBOX.
		so a "reply-and-move-to-same-folder" would be interesting to me.

doc -> contrib ∀ vimrc, muttrc
	=> will break downstream packaging
	announce change, make change in next release

transition guide:
	man neomutt
	a guide for users of mutt moving to neomutt

symlink man pages, etc (for ease of use)
	neomutt -> mutt

getopt for neomutt
	--help
	--version
		"mutt -v | head -1" is pain

sidebar
	have an alternate mailbox like vim's alternate file
	(isn't this the '-' mailbox?)
	create an alias for it '#'
	c# -> change to alternate directory
		new alternate becomes old dir
	save files to #
	set alternate mailbox function
	colour highlight for alternate mailbox
	expando %# for alternate displays '#' or ''

mutt tips on startup
	distribute a contrib/mutt-tips dir which is a mailbox
	select a random (email/tip) from the list
	pick one that's unread (preferably)
	how can we preserve the "read-ness" of an email after a package update?
	.mutt.top-tips ? -- save a list of message-ids in there?
	<top-tips> command creates a new mailbox (from DATA_DIR/DOC_DIR)
		if in /usr it would be read-only
		need to store flags elsewhere
		flags: read, flagged!, deleted (i.e. don't show me again)
	intersperse with mailboxes commands
	tips should be self-contained (to start with)
		unless they reference old tips
		nested emails?  what about multiple inheritance?
		need hyperlinking "see also" links
	use labels (from Keywords plugin) to add value
	use mutt's caching facility to store the metadata

macro instruction <no-history> like vim's <silent>
	some macros end up in the log

new-mail => dbus as a goal, see dgc

doc changes/todo list for limit-current-thread

24-bit colour => non-curses back-end
	enumerate all the curses things we do
	get screen size
	listen for screen size changes (WINCH?)

		configure settings
	save config.h, etc in .git/neobuild
	neobuild --generate

sample IMAP folder (for devs)
	regenerate daily

script to generate min-build
	put in contrib?

Mutt config generator app
	or good (curated) sample config
	tutorial
	translations

add tutorials (like sidebar intro) to the website
	redlink some empty ones (or partials)

	explain all build scripts, etc
	location of source / repo
	howto install
	distro pre-built installs

NeoMutt website top tips?

[management]/bin
	sync.sh 6h cron script to sync mirrors
	sync needs ssh key
		external to script
		(document in header)
	sync reads data file with header, whitespace & comments

sample mail repo filled with example/problem mailboxes

delegation of keys -> focus() -> parent -> global, e.g. IW, Mail
	functions => components (e.g. mail)     }- mail_init() register_functions(); register_commands();
	commands => components                  }

show focus -- sacrifice help line?
	no, it's not always visible
propagation of notifications -- start @focus, work down
	SB, IW, PW + 'q' mail accepts, hides PW, PS, focus IW
	SB, IW + 'q' mail notified, rejects, global accepts, closes app
Help starts @focus, Panel Name + get_keys method
if sidebar is a separate panel and src file, should IW be?  PW?  AI?
If focus is on PW and SB, IW, PW are siblings, how can SB get notifications?
	or does mail Panel catch and iterate through children?
	SB mappings are (index,pager) => behaviour wanted but not in AW

panels have dividers enum
	left
	right
	top
	bottom
	between
	outside
who owns the dividers space?
set_focus (panel)
	who owns the focus?
	gfx(curses)?
	get_char -> gfx_get_char -> consider focus
on close panel, focus moves to
	*prev*/next sibling, or parent?
	due to mutt's UI focus moves to prev sibling
how can I show focus without moving anything? i.e. borders
	sacrifice a top line?
	border highlight?  => always present
which panels *accept* focus?
	sidebar
	index window
	pager window
	<tab> to switch?
	or <left>, <right>?

test email reply to issues, etc
	markdown? NO

website collection of changes since last release -> relnotes on release
	note which branches, etc
website highlight section on toolbar (solid colour?)

new hierarchy: tree => mail's parent is folder or mail

icons for news:
	news: newspaper
	devel: jigsaw, spanner&screwdriver
	release: present, balloons

use links(1) as a model for re-architecting mutt
	mouse control (inc right-click)
	safe html rendering
	pop-up windows
or mc (midnight commander)

update website gh page: list of branches
neomutt FAQ -- containing what?
add my gpg signing key to neo.org, fc.org

fmemopen - merge into one place in mutt_mktemp()?
	idea from dgc email
	do all the callers know the file size?

Do drafts *need* to be stored in a separate folder?
	why not inline?
	in threaded order
	just tagged or coloured
	status flag to denote draft

screenshots on website
neomutt version on website home page

save email doesn't respect the umask

kdave - limit-current-thread
	alt-l (show limit) should respond "limit thread"
	is "limit ." the same as "limit all" -- YES
		fixed internally
	create unlimit patch and pull-request for kdave?
	limit doesn't have any context, just a pattern
	limit-current-thread NEEDS to know current email
	it'd be nice to change limit to accept another "string" arg
	currently
		"all" -> "~A"
	change limit
		"thread" -> "~a" (only letter available)
		let general limit machinery do the work
	unfortunately they can't see the current email
	use context, or change prototypes

vim library of config options(vars)
	auto-extract from mutt_config.c

kill version.c:rstrip_in_place()
	fix external build scripts

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside area of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

cond-date needs some concrete examples

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

replace " with ' in muttrc

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

docs/muttrc/readme/mutt_config.c
	need to document default values for variables

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

git
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares
	gperf to generate perfect hashes

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

data source LDAP
	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistent undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

integrate nntp into sidebar
what does notmuch return?
	how do i link it to existing objects?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate EMAILs
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, email.c, mh.c
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

Unmailbox * ⇒  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

Start; Incoming; Inbox open; current = Incoming; sort → cur is offscreen, boundaries lost

Notify (Box*, Rect old, Rect new, flags)
Flags:
	too small to render
	changed visibility

Changed posn notification ONLY
	e.g. sidebar has swapped sides
could imply that cached data may be OK to reuse
	e.g. don't need to call calc_boundaries

repaint if:
	size changes
	position changes

DBUS plugin -- to do what?
	notify out
	take input to do what?
		accept mailto: links

quiet config option -- don't whine about unknown config options
	or quiet command line option

trim trailing slash from mailboxes, folder
	shouldn't be displayed

New only -- include structure (empty dirs) to keep hierarchy
	mail (0)
	  fruit (0)
	    apple (1)

sorting
	if displaying full paths:
		sort by display name
		sort by underlying name
	if displaying indented paths:
		sort by top-level names, then children

send escape sequence to clear terminal title when mutt closes
mutt_config.c struct option_t needs enums for types and union for data
timer notifications, e.g.
	highlight something for three seconds, then return to normal

wrapping →
	extra char at beginning of line "+"
	extra char at end of line "<-/"
wrap at:
	char
	word (whitespace)
	clause (punctuation)
	sentence (.!?)
No wrap →
	extra char at end of line ">"
