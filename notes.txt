--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

delegate Config object to NeoMutt (don't free it separately)
NV NeomuttView => ndata & free_ndata - wrap gui globals

∀ types
∀ levels N|A|M
∀ (name|HE)
∀ (get|set)
∀ (native|string)

level	HE
N	* --> Global
	^
	|
A	* (value)
	^
	|
M	* (value)

lookups with missing HE -> string
manipulations to generate scope, etc
lookup on unchanged M mean 2 redirects
if M-value is looked at *once*, it's likely to be again
	so always generate

N-sub or Globals ∀ code?
	N-sub where possible
	then convert to (scope-)-sub later

create_inheritance needs to honour INH_ACC|INH_MBOX
if config *can't* be inherited, will all lookups be inefficient?  probably
or drop flags - inherit anything, code will decide N|A|M
NO. need flags to warn user (flags to match code)
inherit where A-sub or M-sub are used
need flags for config dump (add to :set output)
does INH_MBOX imply INH_ACC?  probably
	specify both for clarity?  YES
need to categorise all Config
	NONE (global)
	Account-specific
	Mailbox-specific
	447 config variables
:set -h (help) other options for dump flags, including inheritance

NOT USED
	C_VfolderFormat (notmuch)
	C_MimeSubject (nntp)

create_inheritance
	N-, A, M-sub missing name
degenerate !sub, or !name -- fail
simple name exists return HE
A-sub, parent -->  N-sub exists, create A:name
M-sub, parent --> A-sub, parent --> N-sub exists, create A:name, create M:name

Pass sub to dialogs -- their config scope
What if dlg needs some A- and some M-specific config?
Dlg given M-sub, searching for A-limited config will cause M-inherit!
All gui-config is global -- initially
All index/page config is M-specific, compose too
Alias/query is global
Who checks config setting?  parse_set?  validator?
	magic validator ∀ config to check inheritance?
Add *sub* to dlg, get_config_scope(dlg)?
	change varname from sub to "cfg"
After docs split, break up / comment config lists by N|A|M scope?

{imap,pop,smtp,nntp}_port config?  only settable by URL!
timeouts on variables (for passwords)?
	require all accesses to be through cs/sub
libsend around smtp.c send.c sendlib.c
sort_re docs wrong
why are the 6 charset config not using DT_SLIST?

help backend
	if neomutt started with zero mailboxes, load help
	first email says "Welcome to NeoMutt, press <enter> to continue"
	use localised version of email where available
	then vim-tutor like

Account observes config
{user,pass,login} -> set_X
url change -> wipe settings, set all

need service name "imap", etc
globals - need to parameterise:
	$tunnel
	$preconnect
	$use_ipv6
	$connect_timeout

ConfigAccount - cached credentials (rename?)
if (!has_X) get(X)
	function callback to Account

mx_open -> imap_open -> socket -> sasl (missing creds) -> connect
	sasl needs to ask user for info
	ssl/tls need to validate certificates

missing credentials (before connect) - has to happen here
	*sasl* might ask questions
	accept/reject cert (mid-connect)
		pass in response for testing purposes?
	NO have special version of libquestion

magic pager bar too
create index/pager macros that save/restore
	pager_index_lines
	sidebar_visible
	pager_format
	save to myvars
	if ifdef to only need one macro?

M.verbose for messages -> notification?
	let UI decide if quiet or not

main reuses Buffer *folder confusingly?

main - folder-hook is called before startup-hook
	should it?

pop_fetch_mail()
	move spoolfile, $folder out of pop/

ConnAccount needs method to *push* data
	e.g. ask for a password, then Account saves to config

lots of sidebar settings apply to the browser
	should be account display settings!

folder format needs 'subscribed' flag/field

format format use %l (hard links) to distinguish local/net browser formats (conditional)

:changelog ?
	read from /usr/share/doc/neomutt
	:news ?
	:credits
	:about

auto.def
	list devel features, e.g. magic bars
	add disclaimer

desktop stuff (mailto, icon)
	contrib
	web contrib
	mailing lists
	twitter

backends need splitting
	UI stuff vs pure code (only dep libmutt etc)
	good for asking questions too
	"pop/gui.c" all the wrappers

Add Imap seq letter/fd to all logs?
	need imap_debug() macro

Document Imap compression to user ml (etc)

change imap_error to use macro and MuttLogger correctly
	or eliminate it!  no gettext, uses function names!

backend/path.c ∀ type

webdocs -- collapsed groups in menu need sign saying "open me" '+'?

loglevel for data (imap) showing '\n'?

mutt_inbox_cmp() called by
	browser, sidebar

use startup notification to imap_login()?
	parse config
	"mailboxes" -> A,M generation
what if INBOX isn't subscribed?
	what happens to empty '/' Mailbox?
	Kept -- it was "mailboxes" after all
After config, have A-M tree
	Imap listens for STARTUP
startup:
	startup-notification
	startup-hook
	folder-hook
	open folder
imap uses notify to login ∀ A
	login -> LSUB -> mailboxes
startup-hook
	allows user to make post-config changes / commands
folder-hook
	allows user to make folder-specific changes
open folder

$folder should be tidied on setting - strip trailing slash
probe
	if local dir, squash ../ etc
	imap, trailing / (need Account)
who does the tidying?  when?
	validator/fixer?
	or observer?  NO
		observer -> user set, notify, fixer set, notify!

change reset_tilde to just search all config
	to save keeping list up-to-date

split buffer_expand/resolve into PATH functions and MAILBOX functions!

config: change sort to work like enum -- use Data field
	except allow magic "reverse-", "last-" prefixes

1334 C_ config uses
137 WHERE uses

create mailbox (browser)
	errors on empty -- kill error
	rename, delete too?

{backend}/hcache.c?

change OP_X to exactly match function name?

split up MxOps?
	have backends register their functions?

split mx.c mx_{mbox,msg,path}.c

{backend}/{mbox,msg,path,tags}.c ∀

Distinguish all IMAP logging by its connection details
	create imap_debug() macro
	add prefix field to log_dispatcher_t
	all the functions using mutt_debug() need an adata param/local
	use prefix of [seqid/fd]

new sort option to sort flagged emails first
	include entire thread?

have HomeDir, create CurrentDir for cwd?
	it doesn't change

named mailboxes - check "name" is unique across *A*
compare local fs using dev id, inode id
test ("prefix/%s/suffix", path)
HomeDir, CurrentDir _const_ char *
fix test names: test_pop_path2 -> test_path2_pop
Have HomeDir, create CurrentDir for cwd?
	it doesn't change (yet)

A is global, outside of parse(M, a, etc) so
split parse? for imap to use?  where is A subst?
M-fn(M-str, A (optional)), parse uses stack. imap uses A-self
M-str is de-escaped, de-quoted
parse M is A-stack-aware, get str, get stack A
M-fn() if A A->sub else N->sub.  lookup $folder
	resolve (M-str) -> P; find (P) -> M or ac_add(M) on A
	or new A, ac_add(M), or fail

rename mbox - what happens to hcache?
	what happens currently with IMAP? - lost? unreachable
	NOTHING

credits repo - separate out from management
travis *cron daily* - check main repos for commits
also check translate branch, update if nec, credits, mailmaps
README: sections [123] header, flatcap, admins?
list of committers since last release
list of committers in last 6 months
plus others
repo "credits" style to fit into website
since last release: new/returning
last updated timestamp (if changed)

issue template -> folding section + ``` ?
setenv doesn't accept "X?" to query only "?X"
mutt_date_localtime_l (with C locale?)
bug: HOME=/ neomutt -d6 crashes on startup - fopen failed
define LL_CONFIG even if it's only 5
config logging level, file,rc ':cmd', acc, mailboxes, stack?
test case for saving to a symlinks -> real mustn't overwrite symlink!
test realloc(0), rather than code exception!
cron: check all msg/error for gettext
change #ifdef else -> #ifdef/endif #ifdef/endif for testing both paths?

use mbox driver to open orphan maildir file R/O?  NO, maildir
release check everything with, without pgkconf
doc release-test.sh, shellcheck it
shellcheck hcachever.sh and test output for various releases
mailboxes -spacer "free form string" ?
change twitter to *my* email - access to others?  how?
change_folder_next broken?

Sidebar folding
fold_level
	fold at account only
	fold at any nested Mailbox
exceptions for New, Flagged emails, current Mailbox
Highlight on Account expands all M
	move down to A, highlight on 
	move up from next A, highlight on A's last M!

Sorting
	Mailboxes only by N or count, etc
	Inc A => sort *within* A by N or count, etc

Colour for A, e.g. red + underline
Expandos for
	A: type IMAP, host, user, port, desc
	folded mailboxes: num M, total N, total F, total E, total O, total R, etc
	subscribed expando "*" vs space
	<toggle-subscribed> to view all M
	$sb_show_all?
	<subscribe>/<unsubscribe> to mailboxes/unmailboxes
	<next-sibling>(prev) <parent-folder>
	expandos for *totals* or automagic?

capitalise Autocrypt: code, docs, trans
alias - recent queries as sidebar entries
popup windows - dim(grey) all colours of other windows (how?)
alias tag == groups?
makefile autosetup folding

emails[] split - stepping stone
	backend keeps private array
	notifies to another part of self to update frontent array
	frontend behaves as normal during transition

help page should collate shortcuts
	currently sorted by ASCII
		in keybindings
	M & m distant!

tab name needs format string for "*" notifications
preset, coloured blobs?

for popup windows, or non-focussed, *dim* other windows
	want to preserve indicator presence
	color dim_{text,indicator,bar}
	if unset, don't dim?
	or generate defaults?
	need 3 or 4 indicator colours {focus,dim}_{indicator,highlight}
	sidebar _does_ show dim_highlight

screenshots
	svg - fake sidebar divider line?
	termtosvg - hide cursor

update copyright date

mutt_clear_error() - obsolete?  eliminate?

:verbose set -- like vim
	save location of last setting of var
	config, cli, etc

"mailboxes -folded X"
"mailboxes -recurse X"
	how would the sidebar/maildir declare/process the option?

Window observer WIN_DELETE as d'tor!

cli text mode option - sets $ascii_chars
	how can we do this automatically?

set_focus() -> return old focus, so that it can be returned to

add capability to use external browser to attach files in compose
	it returns a list of files
	e.g. vifm

	syntax?
	new command instead?

off-by-one pager_index_lines doesn't include ibar
sidebar will become the same when divider is in a separate window!
what about users that share config between old/new neomutt (or upstream mutt)?

merge gfx/arch diagrams into doxygen docs?
	where?  how?
	link from dev page

Config
	rather than C_X = val; fn(); C_X = oldval
	create tmp *subset* with that one value changed!
	isolates change from other code/readers/threads!
	will that work?
	if A:M:Cfg and set plain Cfg?
	if unnamed subset, will normal inheritance still work?

"builtin" lots of refs left in docs/code
	validator warning?

flatcap/flatcap/README.md!

analysis-compiler - list all my gcc flags

more test builds with deployment
	scan-build
	cppcheck
	lcov - deploy to website repos

web: add GH release notes emojis to web top-level menus?

put header cache structs in separate *minimal* header files

shellcheck on hcachever.sh

struct Pager -> PagerInfo?

move file deletion out of page
	which callers can be fixed?

iwyu - need review of *
	whitelisted includes - how often?
	list source exceptions
	mutt_curses.h
	review: del all pragmas - try compiling
	create [iwyu] top-level travis branch?
	exceptions are still hard-coded into scripts
	5 files - might be reducible

help_line_format - put custom text at the top
	tie in with account-hooks, macros, etc
	for reminders, etc

compose menu using its own is_tagged
	use EmailList instead
	+5 others in index. nec?
	change subordinates to take EL

mutt_sort_headers actually sorted Emails

status bar idea:
	empty status_format -> do not draw
	using conditional expandos that evaluate to an empty string -> do not draw

debug refresh idea: use greyscale background
	increment each repaint
	need to combine colours
	would need bitfield or flag (changed & visible) on Mailboxes
	or each window has a repaint count
		need way to reset occasionally
		Ctrl-L?

add 'sleep' command
	useful for macros
	allow fractional seconds
	can lua do this instead?

easy: mxapi: mbox_create/delete()
then add to browser, need exists fn too

mxapi open_append - move create? query to neo
backend->does_mailbox_exist()
	no, query user
	be->create_mailbox() OK
	be->open_mailbox()

Mailbox, Email - rearrange members: pure data first, connecting pointers,
	private data, last view data - move into inline View struct?
	move into external view struct?
	func data is from file/server - no config required, no globals
	use hcache as guide to purity of data
	Email shrinks from 192 bytes to 32
	Body shrinks from 176 bytes to 24
	Envelope is 344 bytes

no such mailbox -> link to docs
	fake mailboxes

project "next release"
	rename to "2019-MM-DD" after release
	notes, triage, todo, done

VIM update

credits repo
	thanks, mailmap
	pictures?
	split by recent-ness: last 6 months (with pics), and the rest

split up management repo?

new form for error messages?  two-lines
	first line has error message: "Can't open folder"
	second line has the place: folder, path, url, etc
	simplifies translation strings
	can highlight path
	path less likely to be truncated/wrapped

pager <change-folder>?<enter>q goes back to pager

log macro actions carefully

log all hooks

$folder = /dev/null
	leads to crash (not repeated)

config: can't un*set* enum!

postponed docs don't contain the work "draft"!

post-send hook for doing stuff

M must exist
	what about "sent" or "trash" folders?  which might not
	option to create (silently) missing Mailboxes?
	could be messy

help: macros with descriptions are truncated
	can't see full-text
	need wrapping

account-hook is #ifdef SOCKET!

cli(debug) mailbox dump, print index to screen width formatted
	coloured, batch mode, retval like -z, -Z
	or just dump *new* mail
	multiple mailboxes too, separated by M's path?
	json/xml output?
	eventually split into separate app using libmutt, etc
	use getopt_long -- all platforms >10y

Feature: when entering a field, print errors on the line above
	alternaively, *insert* entry field below message window
	it's empty and invsible unless used!
	could use for completion matches too

mutt_buffer_mktemp() ought to live in muttlib! because of config etc
	buffer.c should have no dependencies (except memory, string)

config validators - allow to change value, clamp, ignore "builtin"

eliminate config.h ∀ .h (29) start with libs

Narrow sidebar idea, when width = 1 (or 2)
	abbreviate to single letter
	use colour to show new (or icon)
	position gives you a clue where new mail is
	width=1 no divider, use bg colour to distinguish from index/pager

rename var tmpfile (it's a libc fn)

drop all email addrs from docs (except mine?)

which commands *might* have observers?
	sidebar fns don't know about/if there's a sidebar!

command events, pass Commands[] index, no other data needed

ACS_VLINE(sb) -> create primitives draw_line(), draw_box()!

eliminate all strtoX(), use mutt_str_strtoX()

Config (accept-disabled-config)
	enable by default
	allow distros to disable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

init base windows main()
(compartmentalised world)
index creates dialog - tree, diagram
dialog has data (state including current Mailbox)
sidebar init -> window
	sb_init(dlg) -> inserts itself
	show data tree to A->M

Index <sb-open> -> sb_fn(open) -> dlg.set_current(M) - index processes
	send notify M changed (sb listens -> need recalc)
Index calls reflow/repaint on dlg, sg reacts, repaints.  Done

On window drag resize, when are recalc/repaints done?
Drag (horizontal) -> SIGWINCH -> reflow root -> *some* windows notify size
(sb no action), (index need recalc), repaint root, skip sb, repaint index DONE
Drag (vertical) (helpbar no change), others repaint

separate re*calc* from re*paint* stages for cleaner refresh?
	functions in Window: recalc, repaint, handle function()
Index->find(ID_SIDEBAR) in dlg, call sb(win, x, y, z)
sb->find(ID_INDEX) in dlg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

idea: magic wrap - regex to ignore wrapping for URLs etc
	or $no_wrap_split

lower case attrset not wrapped!

docs: check paths are correct
	/usr/share/docs/sample

debug-only MARKER logging ∀ colour code paths
	all valid, all error, all dupes, all uncolor non-existent
	if not markers, comments ∀
	LL_MARKER (#ifdef DEBUG) level7 just for testing?

how many ways are there to reply?
	how many config vars/lots affect reply?
	alternates, aliases, bounce, reply-to:, etc
	flowchart?  too complicated?

allow "uncolor obj" for normal objects -> default default (no attrs)
	+ attach_headers, staus, uncolor needs retval

libgui - new logging level?

wrap ColorQuote array, get_quote_color(n)?
use ifndef in /etc/neomuttrc to disable *some* defaults
	colours, bindings

challenge - preserve order of tagged emails, so that
	copy/save occurs in the proscribed order
- need to add to EL_tagged as it happens
- maildir (dest) needs to tweak timestamps to ensure order
  (or save to mbox instead)
tweaking can't happen in backend -- it only sees one file at a time
need MXAPI for fast copy for when src & dst backends are the same
change maildir to use (save to) timestamp, if set (NOW, if not)
saving emails to IMAP, what are files in underlying maildir?
	files timestampted for most recent (topmost)
	received timestamp
mx_msg_open_new(), mutt_safe_message()
maildir_msg_open_new(), md_commit_message()

BUG: hooks not run on initial "mailboxes" command, but are later

deferred config evaluation
	automatic for sensitive variables?
	global contains `script.sh` get_value() evaluates the backticks
	can't be done by config system, only outside can eval ``s

	how much noise?  quite a bit
	unused parameters
	unsigned compare
	uninitialised struct members

core lib
	NeoMutt, Config, Account, Mailbox, Notify
	can it be made independent?
		need to de-gui Email, etc
	core depends on mutt,address,email libs
	config depends on mutt,address,core libs

changing the option strings to the form
	(1a)pple, (2b)anana, (3c)herry
	1(a)pple, 2(b)anana, 3(c)herry
means the translators would be free to reorder the options
and we could eliminate the "abc" letter string
this doesn't look so good
	app1(l)e, bana2(n)a, che3(r)ry
perhaps
	app(1l)e, bana(2n)a, che(3r)ry
or clearer still
	(1:a)pple, (2:b)anana, (3:c)herry
	app(1:l)e, bana(2:n)a, che(3:r)ry

	5 Wait a few releases
	6 Drop muttrc

debug config options
	-O0 -g what else?

"wrapmargin" config option needs deprecating like the synonyms

notifications happen when something happens, e.g. new mail
consider a "no longer any more new mail" notification
negative acknowledgements
each notification
	would be independent
	could be on or off
user is notified when a notification status *changes*

change safe_rename
	ENOTSUP
	EOPNOTSUPP

merge and drop "scripts" top-level repo

test fcntl and flock on /var/spool/mail/mutt file

remote config option
	user logs in - host, user, password
	first email in inbox (artificially old) contains config
	email is encrypted to yourself (optional)
		need local private key
	ask user: "Apply (verified) remote config?" (optional)
	separate files?
		have an entire folder for config
			magic name - neomutt-config
		alias files
		mailcap
		certificates
		anything but caching files
	have email signed -- easily verified

pgpinvoke doesn't escape the filename of the email to encrypt (last param)
therefore
	set tmpdir = "~/.cache/mutt three"
makes it impossible to send encrypted mail

change build to install to ./install
alter my .gitignore to ignore ./install

imap keywords
	work out limitations
	test postpone delete
	expandos with nested threads
	test cases and instructions

need neomutt glossary (search first)
	add to guide

ask lists about slang usage
	drop slang

add rfc1847 gpg
add RFC1522
utf-7 -- RFC 1642, superseded by RFC 2152
rfc3986 - URI

listen for tags -- list somewhere public
https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tags.atom

add make tags (to exclude junk)

in pager, which objects are precious/vunerable
	which might be changed outside of the pager

magic -- set *string*, save *int*
	retrieve which?
	or both?
	retrieve string from Mapping[value]

buffer code solaris9(2005!) check

predefined buffer macros (static)
	=> addstr could fail (out of space)
	easier memory management
	BUFFER256, 1024, etc
	allocate buffer for you & memset it

are imap vars used outside of imap code?
what about sidebar, browser, etc?
keep their own var lists?  register at startup?

now that IMAP, et al, are compiled-in, what's in the docs
	that might be excluded (makedoc conditional)

check management README (missing)

two stage index update?
	hide, refresh
	update
	NO, index vars would still be wrong

ask neou for logo suggestions
	hold competition for art?

use install-sh $(INSTALL) instead of cp

parse_set: unset DT_RX doesn't work

FS layer
	211 fopen, 346 fclose, 285 unlink, 70 rename,
	mkdir, mktemp, stat, exists, (read|write)_(string|char)
	85 seek, flush
	tie in with mmap
	tie in with memstream/buffer/tmp
	distinguish tmpfile, generated help page, partial email
	memstream -> better buffer interface
	canonicalise path (realpath)

Misc
	where are the "source" relative docs?
	alias_file, certificate_file, etc aren't relative
		alias_file
		certificate_file
		debug_file
		history_file
		ssl_ca_certificates_file
	relative to what?
	all *_files relative to:
	1) the source file they're read from
	2) current working directory
	3) User's muttrc? NO
	4) $XDG_CACHE_HOME? NO

RFC
	account command user ml, devel ml

Decide
	#ifdef DEBUG
	move some web/discuss to "hard"
		the ones we really want
	new variable type MAILBOX
		could be a "/path" or "+mailbox"

Searches
	list all GH matches
	10m - classify
		old, config, new, different

add release count to changes doc on web

options accelerator '&' double up to escape
static buffer parse translations on first run
needs to cope with missing options or
options reordered -- still need "letters" internally
NO, need letters in po file

modular mutt: imap & nntp share some functions
"subscribe" -- both should declare and mutt notifies both?
or can it tell whose command it is?

devel list - favourite vim plugins -- promote mine?

each variable type in init.h should have its own validator
(null for free form strings, or unranged numbers)

relative 'source'ing of files doesn't work if the base is a symlink

create an address interface for lookups / completion
	basic plugin uses aliases
	notmuch can supply its own plugin

pgp_invoke_decode
	This is historic and may be removed at some point.
	lots of similar functions being redirected
	strip out?
pgp_application_pgp_handler
	needpass (bool) starts as -1!

warning on muttrc synonyms
	this will be removed in x months
	this will be removed after DATE (better)
	suggest correct command

devel ml favourite git config

off_t used in browser.h
	don't need OFF_T
	ftell long vs off_t

linux kernel
	IS_ERR, PTR_ERR
	container_of
	LIST, list_for_each, etc
	ARRAY_SIZE
	BIT
	min, max, typeof
	swap
	round_up/down

vim-like scrolloff option for pager/index
use travis env / website to control build verbosity
sort format string switches

PR requirement all commits build
	make dist/clean on merge
	not nec of each commit

email
	folding the index
	gettext -> non-optional?
	wide ncurses mandatory?

conceal IMAP password

READMEs tidy review
index folding cf vim
vim plugin - cino options etc

travis/neomutt-test-configs configs & build tags
init.h -> options.[ch]
eliminate WHERE
mutt -D options
shrink authors (split out)

with options split into sources, mutt -D could omit entire sections
	if nothing has been set, e.g.
	all of pop_* have default value

compose bug
	E (edit headers) fails if $editor isn't set

simplify y/n questions.  no more "Are you sure?", just
"Quit? Y/n" -- all ask-yes, ask-no

renew s/mime cert & test & desc steps

create screens overview of all areas of mutt.  provide:
	sample data/emails
	sample muttrc
	instructions to repeat

plugin fs-layer
	basic: files + stat, etc
	adv: file, inotify
	others: fmemopen, mmap, libuv

doc sample branches
	web page with list

neomutt-test-config.sh
	--save dir
	put mutt's in an output dir
	log each numeric name with the compile options

cmdline --about links etc

MacOS iTerm (and OpenBSD's xst terminal)
	Ctrl-O doesn't work
	"stty discard undef" fixes it
some other terms too
	rxvt-unicode, openbsd 6.1 - verified
	"stty flush undef" needed

deprecate ChangeLog*
	they're in the git history
	or abbreviate with extreme prejudice

use signal to interrupt IMAP connect
	at time of resume (after suspend)
	systemd service?

Project management:
	contact distros
	organise web updates
	search for patches

change #ifndef's to #warning too
	#ifndef SYMBOL
	#define SYMBOL
	#warning "Please tell neomutt devs about this
	#endif

double-width index (continuation of first for wide screens)
	| side | index1 | index2 |

coverity -- some code untested due to config options, e.g. openssl
	need coverage test

use *mutt* to generate sample mailboxes
	create folders
	create emails
	etc

branches in neomutt repo may be eligible for a free rebase
	develop in your own repo, and they may not

create doc repo
	have neomutt repo as a "fixed" git submodule
	or a submodule of a doc-gen repo

warn on option synonym usage
	{ "pgp_autoencrypt",            DT_SYN,  R_NONE, UL "crypt_autoencrypt", 0 },
	{ "crypt_autoencrypt",  DT_BOOL, R_NONE, OPTCRYPTAUTOENCRYPT, 0 },
	crypt_autoencrypt is the visible option
	warn if pgp_autoencrypt is used

all example muttrcs
	bring them up-to-date (valid options)
	or delete them

2017-03-22 #mutt
	14:43 <wayne47> is there a way to specify a unique SMTP server per mail box?
	14:44 <wayne47> so that when I read mail via imap from foo.com, outgoing mail uses foo.com and when I read from bar.com, outgoing mail uses bar.com (etc)?

topics for my github repos, icons?

mutt marks -- are they mailbox-local?
	can we distinguish (like vim) between
	`a  mark in this index
	`A  global mark (potentially in another mailbox)
		is it safe to change mailboxes without warning?
		I suppose macros do this

convert the bug-fixes section of the travis build.sh to work on the upstream branch
	(test all commits, with a small spread of configs)

2017-03-06 #mutt
	17:40 <parosen> "set -o vi" functionality in mutt?

when saving a file (being asked for input),
	add a mechanism to expand a mutt variable
	like vim's ^R

or
pre-sent hook, filter before send?
why bother?  should be done in editor?

"source" command relative to $cwd or previous file

categorise all messages in code
	info, warning, error, question
which imply user to do: nothing, be informed, worry, query user
errors should be clear whose fault
user: e.g. type something invalid
config: file invalid / missing

	basic docs
	tidy code (whitespace, etc)
	example config
	screenshots of new features
		text/html screenshots if possible

trash folder: forget the directories idea?      who cares about deleted stuff?
trash needs index panel expando -- Original location
archive *needs* dirs %Y / %From?  auto-create, auto-delete on empty
<empty-trash> function
"empty-trash-confirm" variable quad-type
expando for status bar -- trash-size (bytes/Mb) trash-count (number of deleted)
archive needs X-Original-Dir (like del)
	<unarchive> function
tie archive to notmuch to auto index
status bar needs expando for archive contents in (kb,Mb) or (count)
archive/trash expandos -- unless too heavy to calculate
	consult indexes for results/numbers
	does the index store size?
archive needs rich expando save strategy
	%Y, %m, %d -- lots of dates
	%from, %to, etc authors

offline working
	mutt hangs whenever the network goes down and is essentially useless
	what's needed to make mutt useful without a network?
	"auto-postpone"?
	"send-on-reconnect?"
	cache more information about mailboxes?
	network heartbeat to detect connectivity?

what would be needed to have an 'offline' mode?
	how much extra folder info would we need?
	just keep one copy of the 'last state'
	how much code would need rearranging?
	∀ index items, need availabity marker
		which are local?
		Header, Struct, Body, Attachments

imap force body cache on read
	option for offline working

magic "combined" folder
	mbox part for unchanging, historic stuff

	src code is not a distro, so list it last

enforce real names in git commits?

	pet peeve: when I try to open a gigabyte-sized mbox file with 10,000 messages, I cannot abort that

2016-10-24 20:54 <flip214>
	it would be very nice if switching to an imap folder could be aborted by ctrl-c
	having all headers fetched anew and having to wait for 2 mins, knowing that the wrong folder is being loaded, isn't that nice
	the counter for the headers fetched (N of M) counts up
	Ctrl-C gets ignored

mutt_launcher

	pipe(), fork()
	dup2() to replace stdout,stderr

	what about questions?

2016-10-21
13:24 <mgedmin> on ubuntu I think it's best to 'sudo apt-get build-dep mutt' to get all the libraries

make tags -- ignore standalone tools
	needs to ignore #ifdef TEST, too

external testing
	how many external events can we control?
	how many can we simulate?

move separate tools to a separate tools directory
	adjust ctags to ignore them

should log files be localised?
	make it an option?
	debug -> english?
	hard to debug for other nationalities

development bottleneck
	document more tasks
	delegate more tasks

ifdef needs an "else" condition
	how?

files/dirs are sorted the same way as network folders
	may not make sense

mbsync better than offlineimap?

imap only 'n' messages option
	like $nntp_context

modularise header caching/dbs

19:32 <mykoserocin> is there a way to show condensed DKIM results instead of full "Authentication-Details" header?
19:32 <mykoserocin> e.g. "DKIM: pass" or "DKIM: fail"
19:52 <brendan> mykoserocin, I use the spam marker system for it: spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=pass" "✓"
19:52 <brendan> spam "Authentication-Results: mymta.com; .*dkim=fail" "x"

$source_dir like folder

Passing $VARs to children processes, means
	tell vim about mail rcpt, subject, etc

upstream bug -- folder_format, sidebar_format %n (has new mail)
	shouldn't be cleared if "mark_old = no"
	quit and restart mutt and the flag comes back

2016-08-12
	08:31 <flip214> Hi. Another thing I would love to see: an email arrives in INBOX; I answer it,
		and define the FCC for the sent mail, but the incoming mail is still in INBOX.
		so a "reply-and-move-to-same-folder" would be interesting to me.

doc -> contrib ∀ vimrc, muttrc
	=> will break downstream packaging
	announce change, make change in next release

transition guide:
	man neomutt
	a guide for users of mutt moving to neomutt

symlink man pages, etc (for ease of use)
	neomutt -> mutt

getopt for neomutt
	--help
	--version
		"mutt -v | head -1" is pain

sidebar
	have an alternate mailbox like vim's alternate file
	(isn't this the '-' mailbox?)
	create an alias for it '#'
	c# -> change to alternate directory
		new alternate becomes old dir
	save files to #
	set alternate mailbox function
	colour highlight for alternate mailbox
	expando %# for alternate displays '#' or ''

mutt tips on startup
	distribute a contrib/mutt-tips dir which is a mailbox
	select a random (email/tip) from the list
	pick one that's unread (preferably)
	how can we preserve the "read-ness" of an email after a package update?
	.mutt.top-tips ? -- save a list of message-ids in there?
	<top-tips> command creates a new mailbox (from DATA_DIR/DOC_DIR)
		if in /usr it would be read-only
		need to store flags elsewhere
		flags: read, flagged!, deleted (i.e. don't show me again)
	intersperse with mailboxes commands
	tips should be self-contained (to start with)
		unless they reference old tips
		nested emails?  what about multiple inheritance?
		need hyperlinking "see also" links
	use labels (from Keywords plugin) to add value
	use mutt's caching facility to store the metadata

macro instruction <no-history> like vim's <silent>
	some macros end up in the log

'ifdef' improvement
	ability to check mutt version number
	ifdef VERSION == X
	ifdef VERSION > Y

NeoMutt website top tips?

[management]/bin
	sync.sh 6h cron script to sync mirrors
	sync needs ssh key
		external to script
		(document in header)
	sync reads data file with header, whitespace & comments

sample mail repo filled with example/problem mailboxes

delegation of keys -> focus() -> parent -> global, e.g. IW, Mail
	functions => components (e.g. mail)     }- mail_init() register_functions(); register_commands();
	commands => components                  }

show focus -- sacrifice help line?
	no, it's not always visible
propagation of notifications -- start @focus, work down
	SB, IW, PW + 'q' mail accepts, hides PW, PS, focus IW
	SB, IW + 'q' mail notified, rejects, global accepts, closes app
Help starts @focus, Panel Name + get_keys method
if sidebar is a separate panel and src file, should IW be?  PW?  AI?
If focus is on PW and SB, IW, PW are siblings, how can SB get notifications?
	or does mail Panel catch and iterate through children?
	SB mappings are (index,pager) => behaviour wanted but not in AW

panels have dividers enum
	left
	right
	top
	bottom
	between
	outside
who owns the dividers space?
set_focus (panel)
	who owns the focus?
	gfx(curses)?
	get_char -> gfx_get_char -> consider focus
on close panel, focus moves to
	*prev*/next sibling, or parent?
	due to mutt's UI focus moves to prev sibling
how can I show focus without moving anything? i.e. borders
	sacrifice a top line?
	border highlight?  => always present
which panels *accept* focus?
	sidebar
	index window
	pager window
	<tab> to switch?
	or <left>, <right>?

website: some bug-fixes have gone away -> success page?

∀ new bugfixes -- reference trac number in commit message
test email reply to issues, etc
	markdown?

get travis to build RPMs on neomutt and deploy to github release's artifacts automatically
website front page: do YOU have a mutt patch? -> contact us
website collection of changes since last release -> relnotes on release
	note which branches, etc
website highlight section on toolbar (solid colour?)

new hierarchy: tree => mail's parent is folder or mail

icons for news:
	news: newspaper
	devel: jigsaw, spanner&screwdriver
	release: present, balloons

use links(1) as a model for re-architecting mutt
	mouse control (inc right-click)
	safe html rendering
	pop-up windows
or mc (midnight commander)

update website gh page: list of branches
neomutt FAQ -- containing what?
add my gpg signing key to neo.org, fc.org

fmemopen - merge into one place in mutt_mktemp()?
	idea from dgc email
	do all the callers know the file size?

Do drafts *need* to be stored in a separate folder?
	why not inline?
	in threaded order
	just tagged or coloured
	status flag to denote draft

screenshots on website
neomutt version on website home page

doc travis and coverity options
split source?
	tools/ - standalone exes
	library/ - replacement library functions
	readme/ - obvious

save email doesn't respect the umask

kdave - limit-current-thread
	alt-l (show limit) should respond "limit thread"
	is "limit ." the same as "limit all" -- YES
		fixed internally
	create unlimit patch and pull-request for kdave?
	limit doesn't have any context, just a pattern
	limit-current-thread NEEDS to know current email
	it'd be nice to change limit to accept another "string" arg
	currently
		"all" -> "~A"
	change limit
		"thread" -> "~a" (only letter available)
		let general limit machinery do the work
	unfortunately they can't see the current email
	use context, or change prototypes

vim library of config options(vars)
	auto-extract from init.h

kill version.c:rstrip_in_place()
	fix external build scripts

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside area of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

cond-date needs some concrete examples

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

community script check for update
	date community docs?
	or just rely on commit date?

replace " with ' in muttrc

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

docs/muttrc/readme/init.h
	need to document default values for variables

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

git
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares
	gperf to generate perfect hashes

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

keep revision number for all config items (as a prelude to proper notifications)
	only increment revision number on change
	leads to possible A-B-A problem (change blindness)
	if (ver(format_str) > old_ver) STMT;
	allows code to make informed decisions about caching

which config items require frequent and costly interpretation?
	all format strings -- every line, every refresh

data source LDAP
	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistent undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

integrate nntp into sidebar
what does notmuch return?
	how do i link it to existing objects?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate EMAILs
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

postpone patch doesn't quite work
	1) The PostContext and menu are private, so sidebar can't tell that
	   we're looking at the postponed list after navigation.
	2) After navigating to another folder, you still have to "quit" to
	   get the display to refresh.

alternative to lightweight patch
	don't update info ∀ EMAILs
	just update the current page
	only update lists when the user OPENs a folder
	not when they move the highlight
	could pre-emptively populate the previous/next pages

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
break up init.h, globals.h, functions.h
	init.h option DELEGATE, prefix "sidebar_", callback?
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, email.c, mh.c
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
separate modules -- sidebar, index, pager, help? -- each with
	init()
	notify()
	close()
	config()
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

Unmailbox * ⇒  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

Start; Incoming; Inbox open; current = Incoming; sort → cur is offscreen, boundaries lost

Notify (Box*, Rect old, Rect new, flags)
Flags:
	too small to render
	changed visibility

Changed posn notification ONLY
	e.g. sidebar has swapped sides
could imply that cached data may be OK to reuse
	e.g. don't need to call calc_boundaries

repaint if:
	size changes
	position changes

DBUS plugin -- to do what?
	notify out
	take input to do what?
		accept mailto: links

quiet config option -- don't whine about unknown config options
	or quiet command line option

trim trailing slash from mailboxes, folder
	shouldn't be displayed

New only -- include structure (empty dirs) to keep hierarchy
	mail (0)
	  fruit (0)
	    apple (1)

sorting
	if displaying full paths:
		sort by display name
		sort by underlying name
	if displaying indented paths:
		sort by top-level names, then children

send escape sequence to clear terminal title when mutt closes
init.h struct option_t needs enums for types and union for data
timer notifications, e.g.
	highlight something for three seconds, then return to normal

wrapping →
	extra char at beginning of line "+"
	extra char at end of line "<-/"
wrap at:
	char
	word (whitespace)
	clause (punctuation)
	sentence (.!?)
No wrap →
	extra char at end of line ">"

colours changes
keypress        key, no params
config change   key, value
		ALL, no params
mail status change
	read/unread/flagged/deleted/edited
	MESSAGE_ID, flags
mailbox change
