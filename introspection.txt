Object Introspection: ∀ obj API

get_object_name()	-> "Email"
get_object_type()	-> ED_EMAIL (did - DomainId)
get_members() -> Array[name, uid, type]
get_raw(e, uid) -> intptr_t
get_number(e, uid) -> long
get_string(e, uid) -> string (will coerce other types)
get_is_set(e, uid)?  for conditional expandos?  NO
	only meaningful to *expando*
get_parent(e)? - not always possible (meaningful?)
	*make* is possible
	in the exposed hierarch there will always be a parent
		(until NeoMutt)

need way to kickstart it -- explore tree without objects
get_children(obj) -> Array [name, did]
	obj == NULL -> get root (NeoMutt)
not *obj*, did.  start with ED_NEOMUTT
get_children(did) -> Array[name, did] recurse
∀ did
	get_name(did)
	get_members(did)
	get_functions(did)

get_functions() -> Array[name, OP_XYZ]

need helpers for types, e.g. DateTime to format,
	a full object for this too?
How do View objects fit in?  ED_NEOMUTT_VIEW?
How to get from View object to real object?
	Not possible, could be multiple views
Combine View+Obj - user might want to alter GUI attributes
Which objs are needed to fulfil the Expandos' needs?
Which View objs are needed for Expandos?
