get_plain()	Markup + Source -> text
normalise()	Markup -> Markup(N)
measure()	Markup -> num,num (bytes, cols)		nec?

get_vrow()	plain, normalised markup, measure? (or copy Row)
filter_apply()	Row -> Row
		get_plain(), parse text, act on Markup
		may need other Rows

get_vrow()	get_filtered_text() -> NMarkup, plain, bytes, cols
		if invalid, the Row get changed

should the caller update_row() âˆ€ Rows (that it's interested in)?
or should the PFile update the Rows on-demand?  YES
caller can't know when to update, shouldn't know/care

should Row be abstract?
What does the caller *need*?
	bytes,cols -> measure()?
