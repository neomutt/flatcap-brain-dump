Url Plugin

Just Markup each url with an  internal URL attribute (A_URL) (colour optional)
attr means that Markup will be isolated for url
using the normalised Markup + plain text, gui can easily
	isolate any urls and gen colours + ansi markup
	need coords, so need to honour Segment[]
gui: ∀ visible Rows wrap -> Segment[]




Search

gui does search using Rows: results need to be in *Row*
because they extend beyond the *View*
∀ Row starting at the current position, match in Row
	matches invalidate Row?

cap search at 999 matches -- warn if more
changing direction => re-search



Notes

<help> add "about" tab, with sponsorship info, get involved

Scanning to <end> of file could be done quickly,
	read 1 line at a time to find \n's but don't apply Filters
	mark Row as needing recalc (Filters)

Could be faster still - read 64KiB buffer and scan for \n -> gen Rows

Rows only need offset, bytes in them initially
