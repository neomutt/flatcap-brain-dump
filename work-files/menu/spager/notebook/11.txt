Caching

Layer currently holds Source/Cache/File
Could each Filter hold a cache?
Which Filters even need a cache? -- those that *insert*

diff (advanced) if it tidies
markdown (adv) if it summarises
tidy headers?  prob not, just a bit of whitespace
	-> need custom free()
url(adv) if modifying/marking urls

Filters are great for manipulating text *within* Rows
I need Layers to be able to manipulate *Rows* themselves
Which Filters might manipulate Rows? (and insert/delete/reorder)
	tidy headers - mostly conceal(for weed) + hdr_order
turn off weeding => sort by file/cache offset, unconceal all
turn on weeding => reorder, then conceal -> level 99?  always hidden (or -1)
(need to observer (un)ignore, un)hdr_order too)

some concealed items might want to be viewable - signature, text, etc
plugins/filters should ID their work?
	id42 => these are headers or signature, or [-- attach --] markers, etc
plugin order defines priority
=> if diff owns lines, markdown won't run
plugins needn't ID their lines if further manipulation is allows
how would C syntax look with diff syntax superimposed? (or any base lang first)


Plugins need to register config, colour, commands, functions at startup
must precede config reading / `-e` execution
what happens of `set plugins = x,y,z` in config?
	DT_STARTUP?  NO
	it'd be nice to be able to reorder dynamically

new command `register plugin X` => they're external
