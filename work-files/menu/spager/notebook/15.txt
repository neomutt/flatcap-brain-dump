View

PFile has Rows(raw) into Source(cache)
	has Search(plain)  (plaintext may have only existed briefly)

View wants normalised Markup
	might as well merge Search, easier for gui to process
get_row(n) -> Markup(nromal) + Text(plain)
wrap() -> Segment[]
scan for urls, might be multiple Markup per url
	might be split by Segment too
Each piece of Url needs Window coords



Mailcap Filter

file + mime type => new file (text)
add rows
	how does it know where to add them?
	given a Row number?
want [-- marker --] before text + blank line

currently uses a min of 6 lines
