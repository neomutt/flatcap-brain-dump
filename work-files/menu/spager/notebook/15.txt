View

PFile has Rows(raw) into Source(cache)
	has Search(plain)  (plaintext may have only existed briefly)

View wants normalised Markup
	might as well merge Search, easier for gui to process
get_row(n) -> Markup(nromal) + Text(plain)
wrap() -> Segment[]
scan for urls, might be multiple Markup per url
	might be split by Segment too
Each piece of Url needs Window coords
