Help Tabs

If $help is set -- intro page -- You are Here
	if !help still display tab, but default to tab 2 (bindings?)
	give each tab a stable number for its content

Bindings / Macros (set)
Functions (all possible)
Config - all relevant to current dialog - bold changed config
Misc - e.g. Index flag config

:bind [all|dialog]
:macro [all|dialog]
:color [all|dialog]
:set [all|dialog]

Some cfg/colours are global
Could associate themselves with a Window
If Win is visible then help is given?
	=> sidebar_visible is global, but sidebar* is sidebar dependent

Pager Filters would have to register their config / colours somehow
	:cmd dialog    uses current focus
