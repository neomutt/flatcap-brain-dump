Uses

Info pages: version, colour, bind/macro, <help>, log messages, set
Preview: compose, attach


Info pages are all manually constructed, all small, no file needed
Preview: all mailcap'd to a file, could be very large
Info inset inline ANSI -> in cache (no file, so yes) => save => dump cache
Init from file; cache, parse
Only modification is ANSI colours - always enabled, as safe origin
mailcap'd file could contain ANSI - no nec safe
want cached plaintext for searching, need raw info
=> Row + Markup -> text. still much quicker than reading file
	we kmow how many bytes to alloc
No Layers, 1 Cache (raw) Array [num, Row, text] ?
View can cache *visible* Rows, minimise sizeof(Row)
Data os File, cache, Rows, Markup, Search?


Pluging need to be run in parallel -- don't read a bit file multiple times
i.e. ∀ Row read text, ∀ plugin apply mods
Each plugin could need state info
Parallel even if multiple Layers are needed!
