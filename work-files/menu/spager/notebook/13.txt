View can help PFile by bracketing its needs: I'll need Rows X-Y

Row is cache-specific and gappy, get_row() assembles text, then
Rescale	Row to 0..n (contiguous) for display

View can cache/free *this* Row.
VRow?  probably not

Future cache uses fmemopen / mmap

ViewRow *could* be made smaller that Row, but there are very few of them
