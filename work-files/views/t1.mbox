I had a strange idea yesterday.

I was trying to remember the name of a config item,
but I couldn't remember if it had an underscore or not.

Then I thought, "we should fix that".
Here are my suggested renames

| Old Name                   | New Name                     | Description                                             |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `askbcc`                   | `ask_bcc`                    | Ask the user for the blind-carbon-copy recipients       |

| `crypt_confirmhook`        | `crypt_confirm_hook`         | Prompt the user to confirm keys before use              |
| `crypt_replyencrypt`       | `crypt_reply_encrypt`        | Encrypt replies to encrypted messages                   |
| `crypt_replysignencrypted` | `crypt_reply_sign_encrypted` | Sign replies to encrypted messages                      |
| `crypt_replysign`          | `crypt_reply_sign`           | Sign replies to signed messages                         |
| `imap_servernoise`         | `imap_server_noise`          | Display server warnings as error messages               |
| `include_onlyfirst`        | `include_only_first`         | Only include the first attachment when replying         |

Alternate version
    https://gist.github.com/flatcap/abcc4c03bd61c889a1ec57adf5badf34

The old names would still work (the config systems supports "synonyms")
See:
    https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/mutt_config.c#L760

What do you think?

Cheers,
    Rich / FlatCap

It seems the idea was quite popular.

Would someone like to make it happen?

The task should be pretty easy.

I can point you in the right direction, but I don't have time much
mentoring, at the moment, so you'll may need to work some things out for
yourself.

If you're interested, let me know (email or IRC).

| man neomuttrc | grep Type: -B 1 -A 0 | head -8
|        abort_backspace
|               Type: boolean
| --
|        abort_key
|               Type: string
| --
|        abort_noattach
|               Type: quadoption


this lookup from the manual would be easier
if all opton names were prefixed with "Option:".

| man neomuttrc | grep Option:

with this keyword it would not matter if
the option name has an underscore or not.

another idea:
when you put both Option:
and Type: onto the same line..

| Option: abort_backspace Type: boolean
| Option: abort_key       Type: string
| Option: abort_noattach  Type: quadoption

.. then grepping for a given Type: also gave
you all the option names of the same type:

| man neomuttrc | grep Type:.boolean

unfortunately, adding the Defaults to the same line does
not work well as typically the Strings are pretty long.

| man neomuttrc | grep 'Default: "[^"]\{12,\}"'

but maybe there are even easier ways for these lookups?

Hi Sven,

> if all option names were prefixed with "Option:".

Hmm... that would add a lot of visual clutter.

One idea I had was to split up the *detailed* docs for the config
(they'd move to other, more relevant, sections of the guide)
and create a single page, a one liner table with lots of links.

Perhaps:

    | ...  |      |                                 |
    | wrap | bool | Width to wrap text in the pager |
    | ...  |      |                                 |

Cheers,
    Rich / FlatCap

Hi Sven,

> if all option names were prefixed with "Option:".

Hmm... that would add a lot of visual clutter.

One idea I had was to split up the *detailed* docs for the config
(they'd move to other, more relevant, sections of the guide)
and create a single page, a one liner table with lots of links.

Perhaps:

    | ...  |      |                                 |
    | wrap | bool | Width to wrap text in the pager |
    | ...  |      |                                 |

Cheers,
    Rich / FlatCap

an extra alias/function/script is certainly nice, but
it is yet another thing to learn about and to remember.

i'd rather add "opt:" before each option.
this is an easy change.  and many people
will definitely recognize this simple patterm
in the neomuttrc and then search for it:

 man neomuttrc | grep opt:

this can certainly be mentioned in the docs,
maybe even in the neomuttrc itself. :)

Hello everybody,

Ihor recently expressed slight interest in using sourcehut and flatcap
said a) it should not be cumbersome or decrease efficiency compared to
github and b) he doesn't want to worry about payment. And c) github
gives neomutt visibility.


So i talked to Drew DeVault about this and he said that we should not
worry. Financial aid, that is using sourcehut for free, will always be
possible for us without questions asked. Well we have to write an email
to Drew asking for it but that's it. Additionally, if my life stabilizes
again i will be able to pay regardless. So the financial part is worked out.

Now i suggest:

* I create a git mirror on sr.ht (or flatcap if he wants to be the owner)

* we create a neomutt-patches mailinglist on lists.sr.ht and announce it
here.

* we create a builds.sr.ht CI which will automatically build incoming
patches sent to the neomutt-patches list.

* still use github issues for tickets

When a patch is sent to the neomutt-patches list like [1], the
builds.sr.ht will notice that and run the CI. when that is done, the CI
will sent a mail to the thread, which will look like that:

-------------------

scm.sr.ht/patches: FAILED in 3m55s

[Support .mkd extension for README files][0] from [Anna “CyberTailor”][1]

[0]: https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-dev/patches/21274
[1]: mailto:cybertailor@gmail.com

✗ #463076 FAILED  scm.sr.ht/patches/alpine.yml   
https://builds.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/job/463076
✓ #463077 SUCCESS scm.sr.ht/patches/archlinux.yml
https://builds.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/job/463077
✓ #463078 SUCCESS scm.sr.ht/patches/debian.yml   
https://builds.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/job/463078
---------------

As you can see, it will show which builds failed and give a link to the
build job. When you include the X-Sourcehut-Patchset-Update header in
the mail answer to the thread lists.sr.ht will update the status of the
mail[2].

So in essence, i think this actually increases efficency:

1) people who have technical trouble with github for some reason (like i
do currently) can still sent work out for review.

2) it gives us additional visibility on the sr.ht projects page[3]. I
think Drew might even feature our neomutt project for some time, so it
will very prominently be shown on this page: https://sr.ht/ (those
featured projects rotate from time to time).

3) reviewing things in email is more efficient for some people since you
can do everything in the terminal.

thoughts? how many people would subscribe to the neomutt-patches
mailinglist? specifically i am interested what you gahr and flatcap
think about this. Would you subscribe to the neomutt-patches
mailinglist? would you review things there? would you be interested
trying this neomutt-patches mailinglist for your own work?

I am very curious what you all think.

tl;dr NO.

If people want NeoMutt to succeed, they need to help.

Any user could add to / improve the docs.  But they don't.

Many of the thousands of NeoMutt users could help answer other users'
questions.  But I don't see that happening, either.

There are probably three people who understand the code, in any depth.
They need to concentrate on the code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm working full-time on NeoMutt.  And it's not enough.

People keep suggesting ideas about using this tool, or that methodology,
but unless it reduces MY workload, then I'm not interested.

Setting up a project on another server just multiplies the amount of
work needed to coordinate the project.  Another mailing list is just
another place where I won't look.

Don't do it, unless you're prepared to manage it and convert all the
mailing list posts into GitHub Pull Requests, so that I don't have to.

Adding a new platform won't magically solve our problems.

Cheers,
    Rich / FlatCap

There are several layers of what I think and I'll try to be systematic
and methodical in laying it all out. Additionally I'll try to explain
flatcap's stance on the subject.

On the surface the idea of using sr.ht is great. That platform has
certain advantages over GitHub, including but not limited to email patch
workflow and more OSes available to CI. And so enthusiasm about using
this platform is understandable.

Now, one has to consider the cost of setup and maintenance that adds up
to existing costs. The term "cost" that I'll use below is somewhat
handwavy, as it is hard to define some of it's components. It is mostly
time and human cognitive capacity to hold and switch contexts. All
humans have very little amount of this both of these resources.
And the cost is not uniform between features, so I'll try to break it
down by feature:

- Mirror on sr.ht is fairly high amount of maintenance, because it is
  one more place to look at, one more place where sync can break, one
  more place to keep secure, update passwords, share access etc.  In
  other words it is one more "house" that somebody has to own and take
  care of. I don't want to own and maintain it. Neither does flatcap.
  If you feel like doing it - you don't need our permission, it is
  opensource, set up an unofficial mirror.

- CI platform itself has probably the lowest cost among the offered
  features. And *just* sr.ht CI can be used without setting up the
  mirror on sr.ht (as I did on opensmtpd project). It integrates with
  GitHub nicely and one can see failed or successful check in a PR, same
  as GithHub actions, Cicrcle CI, Travis or any other CI platform.
  This is the only thing that I thing is worth taking a closer look at. 

- Email patch workflow has the highest overhead in my opinion. It
  requires a mirror to be set up. It also complicates mirror setup as
  now 2 way sync is required to prevent divergence. As much as I like
  emails I think the tooling is for this workflow to be efficient is not
  there yet. It is one more place to context switch to, one more mailing
  list to read. Believe it or not - not many people even know how to use
  emails and patches together these days. Occasional patch sent to devel
  mailing list has significantly lower overhead today than setting up
  and maintaining sr.ht email patch review platform.

Pair this with the fact that neomutt already has a couple of CI
platforms set up. The added benefit of yet nother CI and is somwhat
marginal, the law of diminishing returns an all that.

Now, please don't take offence on flatcap's harsh NO response. Instead
try to put yourself in his shoes: he is the *only* stable maintainer of
neomutt. All others, including me and you, are come-and-go weekend
warriors.  Flatcap has to perform a full range of duties like reviewing
and merging  PRs, categorizing and  replying to issues, rebasing stale
PRs to keep them up closer to master, maintain 2 mailing lists, and take
occasional patches sent there and put them into repo. He also writes a
shit ton of documentation (pardon my French, but have you seen how much
there is?) to make the life of other developers easier, he maintains an
IRC channel and neomutt's website. He has to maintain a mental map of
all the neomutt's code (and the codebase is huge) to be able to review
the code and respond to our stupid questions, ensure stability, make
releases etc.  Finally needs to find time to write some code too.

So as much he might be excited about new things he simply can't afford
them right now.  He is a human and there are only 24 hours in a day and 
we are asking him to do even more. Taking something into official repo
is a commitment.

If you really want to help try to think you how can combine achieving
your goal and help reducing(or at least not  increasing) his burden. 
Here are my suggestions of how this can be done:

- Write build manifests to sr.ht CI, submit them for review, I will help
  you with integrating it into neomutt's CI, I can take care of the rest
  of sr.sh CI setup (I already have an account there). We can run sr.ht
  CI tests as optional as a start, later we can promote them to
  mandatory if they prove to be useful and low overhead.

- It is entirely possible that we are missing an untapped reserve of
  contributors who are willing to work only on sr.ht and contribute by
  sending patches. Set up a mirror, take care of bi-directional sync.
  You can have a branch in main repo to mirror back sr.ht.
  Convert a stream of email patches to Pull Requests in official repo. 
  I am sure flatcap will say "thank you".
  By acting as a mediator between the main repo and your mirror you will
  achieve what you want, and help flatcap, without putting more work on
  his back. See for  yourself how much maintenance this is. Try to automate,
  improve the workflow.  We can mention alternative workflow in the
  README. 

- Alternatively you can help flatcap with his current focus - refactor
  the codebase. Make it more approachable, readable, testable. This is a
  long game, but it leads to sharing flatcap's knowledge of neomutt, and
  taking some of burden off his plate. With time we can return to sr.ht,
  when we have more manpower, or lower maintenance overhead of the
  existing code.

The bottom line is this: you are asking for features, but they mean more
work for us (more different kinds of work). In return I offer this work to
you, as we can't take more work now. This is how community works, by
sharing responsibilities, ownership and work, I hope you understand.

P.S. Sorry for long email. It would've been shorter if I had more time to
formulate my thoughts better and shorter.

A random bit of trivia...

When NeoMutt split from Mutt, the repo contained ~6000 commits.

Recently, the stats looked like:

    Mutt     8000 (+2000)
    NeoMutt 14000 (+8000)

Background: I'm trying to improve how NeoMutt internally handles tagged sets of emails.

If I tag ten emails, then perform an operation on them,
in which order would you expect them to be worked on?

For example, if you piped them to an external program

- User's sort order
  Top to bottom in the order they'd appear in the index
  (including any threading)

- Selection order
  The first email tagged would be processed first, and so on.
  Typically, the user would tag top-to-bottom in the index,
  so this could be the same as the sort order.

- Unseen order -- dependent on other factors, e.g. the mailbox type
  - Maildir:   Alphabetical
  - Imap:      By UID (Unique ID)
  - Generally: By memory address (for speed)

What do you think?

Cheers,

## Notes

It's been a busy month for NeoMutt with five new contributors.
They've been fixing things and adding new features.

If you'd like to help, come say "Hello!" in our IRC channel, or email me.
There are plenty of simple jobs to get started on, and *mentoring* is avail=
able.

- `#neomutt` on `irc.freenode.net` (or https://webchat.freenode.net/?channe=
l=3D#neomutt)
- Richard Russon (@flatcap) <rich@flatcap.org>

This release sees some more modernisations.

- Compose: can now display user-defined headers (see `my_hdr`).
- Address Book / Query: can now be searched using patterns:
  - `~f` Alias (*f*rom)
  - `~t` Address (*t*o)
  - `~c` Comment

- Config: String Lists now support `+=3D` and `-=3D` to add/remove items.
  Strings now support `+=3D` for concatenation.
