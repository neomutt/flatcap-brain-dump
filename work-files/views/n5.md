This ugly diagram shows the main objects and their members.
The ones shown in red are GUI-specific and should be in objects on the left-hand-side.

## `Mailbox` Parts

- `emails[]` - A simple array of `Email*`
  The backends routinely alter this array, sorting it, adding to it, removing from it.

- `v2r[]` - Array of ints that index entries in `emails[]`
  This gives us the flexibility to show subsets of the Email list

- `ThreadsContext` - A tree of `MuttThread`
  This maps the threaded tree layout to the emails.
  It's independent of `emails[]` and `v2r`.

- Hash Tables - Four lookup tables for efficient searching
  - `Mailbox`: "message-id" -> `Email`
  - `Mailbox`: "subject" -> `Email`
  - `Mailbox`: "x-labels" ->` `Email
  - `ThreadsContext`: "message-id" -> `MuttThread`

## Frontend Events

What do we need to be able to do?

- Cold setup - Mailbox is opened for the first time.
  We want to setup `v2r` from empty.
  This will depend on `$sort`, etc.

- User alters `$sort`, etc
  `emails` will be re-ordered.
  `v2r` will be reconstructed to match `emails`

- User applies a `<limit>`
  Flag non-matching emails in `v2r`
  Remove the non-matching emails
  Squash down `v2r`

- User applies collapses a thread
  Lookup the current email in the `ThreadsContext`
  Recursively remove each of its children from `v2r`
  Squash down `v2r`

- User removes a '<limit>'
  Reconstruct `v2r` from `emails`

- User removes uncollapses a thread
  Lookup the current email in the `ThreadsContext`
  Recursively insert each of its children into `v2r`

## Backend Events

The external events can be broken down into:

- New emails arrive
- Emails are deleted
- Mailbox is synchronised

### New Mail

The frontend typically calls `mx_mbox_check()` to check for new mail.

This is the simple case.
The backend creates new Emails and adds them to the end of `emails` (resizing it if necessary).
If there's new mail, it causes the Index to be resorted.

Unfortunately, after the Emails are added, the backend "helpfully" resorts the array.

### Deleted Mail

This gets a bit trickier.
The backend will delete the `Email`, then squash down the `emails` array.
The Index is notified **after** the changes have happened.
It needs to be sure it's not going to use any deleted emails and the `v2r` is
now out of date, so must be reconstructed.

### Synchronise Mailbox

In theory, this should be a combination of new mails arriving and old emails
being deleted.  In practice, anything could change and the Index **tries** to
keep the same focussed email, etc.

## Problems

What are the problems?

The Index is given too little information, too late.
The `emails` array can change without warning, and Emails can appear or disappear.

The `v2r` is tightly bound to `emails`.
Almost everything the backend does, means it needs to get rebuilt.

The `ThreadsContext` is entirely separate.
Any new Emails need inserting into the tree and any deleted Emails removing.

## Ideal Behaviour

The Index's data is separate and independent of the backend's data.

The Index is notified of changes with a list of emails.

- **After** new emails arrive or emails are changed.
- **Before** emails are deleted.

Changes to the Index shouldn't affect:
- The current selection (unless it's deleted)
- Contents or position of the Pager (unless it's deleted)
- The state of collapsed threads
