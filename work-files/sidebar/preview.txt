Display a preview window in the Index Dialog
(like the opposite of pager_index_lines)

pager_index_lines shows the Index, but the focus is on the Pager
index_preview_lines shows a mini-Pager, but the focus is on the Index

optionally, don't mark emails as read when peeked at
	marking emails as 'read' meaning being non-passive
	updating email and notifying the index

OP_DISPLAY_MESSAGE works as normal, opening the Pager (real)

Preview window won't display headers
Needs options:
- abbreviate the usual intro text, "Hi Bob,\n\n", etc
- hide quoted text?
- abbreviate good/bad signature info
- abbreviate attachment info
- fold/compress all lines
- elide blank links / empty quoted "> "
- preview_bar (format string)

docs: strongly recommend enabling message cache

can we save a line by using background colour to separate?

perhaps no preview_bar -- most info is already available in the index/index_bar

should we re-use the pager/pager_bar or insert our own
probably insert our own -- completely independent

where to insert it?
in PanelIndex at end after Index,IndexBar
need to tweak status_on_top checks/manipulations

need Index/Dialog-level notifications of:
- "current" Email
- focussed Window (Index or Pager)
  general change-focus notification (from dialog_push?)
