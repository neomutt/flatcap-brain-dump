Lightweight Rows / Layers?

If we have lots of Rows and many Layers, how much memory will be used?
File of 5000 Rows, Cache raw text  (40KiB of Row ptrs)
Each Row { offset, segments, etc }
Each Layer  Row*[] which *reuses* many Rows
Could squash Rows into a results Row - saving space, but
Layers still need to exist to hold the in-use caches!


A Row's offset is specific to the Layer's File/Cache
If we merge Rows, we need to know which Row/offset refers to which Cache
Row holds Layer ptr, Results Layer is unaltered Row from previous Layers


						Parent		Data		Name

Results Layer	->	Row	Segs[]		-> Layer	-> File Cache	raw

				Segs[]		-> Layer	-> File Cache	headers

				Segs[]		-> Layer	-> File Cache	body

				Segs[]		-> Layer	-> File Cache	attach


This doesn't work.  Can't reuse data from previous Layers because
we don't track which offsets refers to which cache!


If Row's Segs reuse prev Layer's cache, then insert some text from their
own Layer's cache it fails
