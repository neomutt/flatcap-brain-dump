View

PFile has Rows(raw) into Source(cache)
	has Search(plain)  (plaintext may have only existed briefly)

View wants normalised Markup
	might as well merge Search, easier for gui to process
get_row(n) -> Markup(normal) + Text(plain)
wrap() -> Segment[]
scan for urls, might be multiple Markup per url
	might be split by Segment too
Each piece of Url needs Window coords



Mailcap Filter

file + mime type => new file (text)
add rows
	how does it know where to add them?
	given a Row number?
want [-- marker --] before text + blank line

currently uses a min of 6 lines
	[-- Attachment #2: apple.png --]
	[-- Type: image/png, Encoding: base64, Size: 68K --]

	[-- Autoview using identify '/tmp/mutt/apple.png' --]
	/tmp/mutt/apple.png PNG 236x250 236x250+0+0 8-bit sRGB 51926B 0.000u 0:00.000



"eol" colour attribute - extend to end-of-line
	e.g. comment, signature
is this settable?  or fixed to a colour?
where does it show up?
	commands in info pages
	log message
	email headers
	signature?
	quoted?
	normal (obv)
	body (prob)
	(sidebar_)indicator
	status
	stripe_(even|odd)
	message|warning|error


if config changes (or colours, commands, functions) - can the Filter invalidate *just* a few Rows?
how would the Filter *know* which Rows?
	which text would they be checking?  Raw? already-filtered?
Does it matter?
	invalidate all and View will recalc as necessary


:version
	drop MT_COLOR_BOLD and use ANSI bold instead -- simpler
	don't wrap compile features?  simpler


Row: limit first, bytes to 32-bit unsigned (4GiB) to reduce size
