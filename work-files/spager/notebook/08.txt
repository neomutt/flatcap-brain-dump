Existing File

View attachment : raw email -> mailcap -> file (could contain ANSI)
Create PFile, Layer(file, 64KiB cache) = Source
creating Rows -> reading entire file
we start with zero knowledge
how to we lazily read?
	distinguish between EOF and as yet unread


PFile has file size. NO
Layer has 0 Rows, Layer has Source (file size)
Display wants n Rows.  Layer.get_row(6) => 0-6 must exist
get_row() => NULL if beyond EOF
get_row(n) checks Row(n-1) offset, len => offsetN
Source -> get_row(offset) fill 64KiB cache if nec
can cache fulfil request?  yes, return, no read file, return

Who applies Layers?  (ANSI)
plugins act *upon* Layers, potentially multiple plugins/Layer
caller, Layer(existing fp), ANSI(Layer)
L2 = dup_layer(), BodyColours(Layer2)
can plugins be limited to a range of Rows?
	how to do this lazily?
*Row*-wise to avoid re-reading file (lazily)
Layer has array of plugins to apply automatically?
	each with *state*
How does header/weeding plugin row *Row*-wise?
Email Pager needs to process entire Body immediately
even if big.  attachment text can be left to parse lazily
Email Pager has *file* - perhaps we populate the PFile manually
