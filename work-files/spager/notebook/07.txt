Raw vs Plain

Markup[] lots of (offset,len) into "raw text"
Markup[] + Row => "plain text"
Search -> (offset, len) in plaintext could span raw bits -> gaps!
offsets into plaintext align with screen perhaps we don't need to align to M

Display M(0,3),(6,2),(18,3), S(2,5)
	"abc"  "de"  "fgh"   "cdefh"
âˆ€ M screen col = 0, M 3 cols intersects with S(), split

print	M "ab", S "c"		part *before* search, part in search
	S "de", 		entirely within search
	S "fg", M "h"		part *in* search, part *after* search


Diff Plugin
colours, config, functions
<fold_more|less> like vim
$fold_level, all fold cfg, etc, could be reused in Index
<next|prev_chunk|file> for navigation
(reg functions, if not already defined)
(reg keybindings, if not already defined!)
navigation functions open folds as necessary
search needs to do the same HOW?
plugin functions need priority over Pager
unless search is fold-aware
$fold_open = search?
