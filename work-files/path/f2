local path FILE|DIR
can't change HOMEDIR
seldom compare
flags: must exist?  create path?
P { desc, orig, canon } set to "./" (relative) expand when needed
set to full path, expand path (but save) - NO ~bob!
should P {} contain pretty?  solves freeing problem
Local has no desc (only M)  pretty(P, folder) or HomeDir (*folder* has priority)
M.config -> MxAPI visible need A, $folder ???
Most M.config would be relative "$trash" what use is a config type?
pretty/expand  local, M(net), M(local)  mx_path2_pretty()
Config + Local?  tidy = dupe of local code?
