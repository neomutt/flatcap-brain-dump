Here's a walk-through of <save-message>

1   s -- <save-message> / OP_SAVE

2   Ask user for a location: L

3   Search all Mailboxes for a M->path->desc that matches L
    Priority is given to the Mailboxes on the current Account.
    If successful, go to Step 9

4   Resolve L into a Path P
    Resolve NeoMutt shortcuts, such as +, ^, !, ...
    Probe P to determine its Mailbox type
    Tidy P using the API function: path_tidy()

5   Find an existing Mailbox by Path P
    Search all Mailboxes, for a match
    Use the API function path_compare() for comparisons
    If successful, go to Step 9

6   Does the path exist?
    Use the API function path_exists()

7   Create the path? (if necessary)
    Use the API function path_create()

8   Create a new Mailbox M
    The new Mailbox wraps and takes ownership of P

9   Open the Mailbox
    Use the API function mbox_open()

10  Create a new Context (if necessary)
    The new Context wraps and takes ownership of M
