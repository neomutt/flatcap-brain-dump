Hi Andr=E9 and Andy,

You've both offered to translate NeoMutt into German.

Thank you.

You're my guinea pigs for this.  I *think* the job will be fairly easy.
But, if in doubt, ask.  I'm never far from my email or our IRC channel
(#neomutt on irc.freenode.net)

NeoMutt builds upon Mutt, so we've inherited its translations.
Mutt hasn't changed much (in years), so most of them are still correct.

    1270 : Total number of strings to be translated
    1073 : Already translated
     122 : Fuzzy -- need checking by a human
      75 : To do -- need translating

Some of the 'gettext' docs may interest you:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Concepts
    https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#PO-Files
    https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#c_002dformat-F=
lag

I've attached the 'po' file.  If you just want to work with that and
send me updated copies that's fine.

However, if you'd prefer to work with git, you can get the latest
version from the "devel/translate" branch of the NeoMutt repository.

    git clone -b devel/translate https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt.git

There are plenty of tools to help you with the translation.
I've had a play about with "poedit" and it seems pretty good.

If you wish to leave comments in the translation, prefix them with "# "
If you think that the comment should apply to ALL translations, let me
know and I'll update the source.

If you'd like to organise the work amongst yourselves, great.
If not:
    Andr=E9 take the first  half of the file
    Andy  take the second half of the file

Thank you again,
    Rich / FlatCap

PS Andy, I've already included the changes you sent me.
