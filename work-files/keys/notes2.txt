Self-Contained Window

3 nested Windows: dlg_apple -> dlg_banana -> dlg_cherry

main()
{
	dlg = A.new()
	setup(dlg)
	rc = dlg.run()
	res = results(dlg)
	free(dlg)
}

AppleWindow
	wdata
	recalc()
	repaint()
	reflow()
	dispatcher()

dlg.run() - event loop
set focus()?  NO, dialog shold decide this
loop until - what?
	refresh all
	get_ch() / mouse / timeout
	offer event to Win.dispatcher()
	(or parents/siblings?)
	up to RootWindow

user hits 'x' - who translates?  where?  how?

DlgIndex
	Sidebar
	Index
	Pager (focus)

each Win has a dispatcher
If Pager doesn't accept 'x', then
parent DlgIndex gets asked
DlgIndex is responsible for checking Index, Sidebar
