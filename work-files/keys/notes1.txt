Key / Mouse Handling

Event loop manages the keys
Calls dispatchers in turn looking for a match
Responses: NO MATCH, LONGER, MATCH
if queue contains a macro string, MATCH returns length

dispatcher has (multiple) mapping table(s)
translates 'x' to OP_ABC
tables contain hard-coded defaults
	configured bindings
	configured macros
	mouse bind/macros too

Event contains
	key(s)
	mouse event + modifiers
	focussed Window
	mouse coords

bind index x fn		uses Index table
bind pager y fn		uses Pager table
			(which is a superset of Index table)
needs to be to allow config binding
macro index Button1 <select><display-message>
