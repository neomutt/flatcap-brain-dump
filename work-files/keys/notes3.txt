Mouse

event loop -> get_ch() -> mouse event
event could occur beyond current window
	who checks?  who delegates?

mouse event: raw, binding, macro
	who expands?  when?

raw -> window.mouse() - hard-coded response
bind -> translation (dlg-specific) -> function
macro -> translation (dlg-specific) -> string of fn

universal event queue
op code for every mouse combo?
	S/C/A-Button(1-6) !
	need modified flags S,C,A on events
	event is a triple (modifier,button,event)
