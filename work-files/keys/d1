∀ Dialogs: register menu, functions
uniq names, ids ∀?
NO, names can be dupes, but not IDs

specials:
	generic -> Menu
	simple dialog
	sidebar -> registered by Index (AND Alias in future)

multi-reg =>
	bind index   x sidebar_next	is Index+Sidebar only
	bind sidebar y sidebar_next	is Sidebar only
		"Sidebar only" => any use of the Sidebar

does Pager limit which Index functions are possible?  HOW?
Which Index functions are *NOT* available?
Can Index just ignore them?  probably

register_fns("alias", ALIAS_FNS)
register_fns("alias", SIDEBAR_FNS)
	=> alias_dispatcher()
	   sb_dispatcher()
