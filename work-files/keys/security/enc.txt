Hi Rich,

This is a test for commit a2a1eb58b28273e0d84f97403deebbab940d1dd0,
with which I think I've finished the development of the fix for the
first two vulnerabilities (I still need to document it, but the behavior
is good already, I think).

I've protected all address lists + In-Reply-To.  This message only uses
=46rom, To, Cc, Bcc (not protected), and Reply-To.

BTW, do you see two encryption info blocks in this mail, or one?

Have a loveyl day!
Alex
