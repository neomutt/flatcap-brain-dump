As prompted by @flatcap in <https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/4249#issuecomment-2053593979>, here goes a global overview of what's in my head.

I used ASCII art; I hope it's detailed enough.

```

*1:	The warning above would happen if a recipient does not apear in
	an AddressList.  This would imply knowing the owner, which is
	complex, and as you said slow, so we probably don't want it.

*2:	The warning above would happen if an AddressList element cannot
	decrypt the message.  This would be similarly slow and complex,
	so we probably don't want it.

*3:	No gratuituous blanks after the begining or before the ending [-- ... --] markers.

*4:	Blank line is part of this block.  This one is meaningful, and
	should be printed if the header area is printed; even if the
	header area has 0 fields!

*6:  We should always protect these fields in outbound email.
       Not doing so is a security risk with no benefits (other than maybe repudiating one's own signed mail).
       Edit:
       I feel like relaxing this, to just document that users shouldn't let headers unprotected.  Silently ignoring `$crypt_protected_headers_write` might be more problematic than keeping it around.

*7:  BCCs should be hidden recipients.

*8:  AddressLists should be protected.

*9:  In-Reply-To should be protected.

*10:  Unprotected fields should be trusted when replying.  (EDIT: I obviously meant `should NOT`)

*11:  This warning should be relatively easy to implement, I think.
