so mutt becomes responsible for what sendmail does?  I think not.  If
mutt's internal's fail to complete an action, it should provide notice,
but not an action after handing off.  If mutt hands off a mail to an app
to provide a special format/action and that "app" fails, the "app" would
provide notice but mutt is not responsible.  If in this case sendmail or
it's representative fails and provided mutt notice, then mutt should act
on that notice.
