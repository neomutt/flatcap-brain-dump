fix hcache vs bcache dir discrepancy
	bcache imaps:flatcap-mail@flatcap.org
	hcache imaps_flatcap-mail_flatcap.org
only mutt_encode_path() the *path* bit
	assume home dir and config are already valid
check upstream's docs/behaviour for cache config with/without trailing '/'
do we consistently mkdir on both?

set header_cache      = "~/.cache/mutt/"
set message_cache_dir = "~/.cache/mutt/aaa@apple.com"

set header_cache      = ""
set message_cache_dir = ""
