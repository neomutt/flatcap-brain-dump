More NeoMutt config files

theme, keys, aliases -- specially named config files
look in default places
in dirs, look for X.rc: theme.rc, etc
in home look for .neomutt-X, ~/.neomuttrc-theme

on startup only load "theme", "keys" if GUI
is "aliasees" needed for CLI usage?, can you email @flatcap?

defainted files => could allow NeoMutt to write to them / maintain them
"aliases" => auto-set $alias_file (if unset)
=> "theme" => auto-set "$color_file" / "$theme_file"
