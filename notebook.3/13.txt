Split Opcodes

OP_ALIAS_XYZ -> OP_ALIAS, OP_ALI_XYZ
central domain id in libcore?
all OPs in specific library
dispayers(op- -> (did, opid)	(add "int count" for later)
one dispatcher per domain
domain id needn't be global -- used in few places
	menu/keybindings, dispatcher
dispatchers need changing, but not function callbacks
	they're specific to dispatcher
change will break docs generation

OpAlias: "delete-entry", OP_DELETE
AliasDefaultBindings: OP_DELETE, "d"
gui/opcodes.h _fmt(OP_DELETE, "delete the current entry")

This works until a Menu has non-local Ops
	(OPs from some other domain)
	how would the code include them?
		as long as "alias" includes entire *SUB*Menus, e.g. OpGeneric
		then only 'OpGeneric' needs to be exposed
	how would the docs resolve them?
		doc look for `_fmt` * `OP_...`
