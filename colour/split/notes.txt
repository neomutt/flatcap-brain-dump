Plan to Split up the Colours

Rather than a central repository, libraries could maintain their own

- c0 All Colours
- c1 Core Colours
- c2 Sidebar Colours
- c3 Compose Colours
- c4 Index Colours
- c5 Pager Colours
- c6 Message Window Colours

Future:
- Alias Colours
- Browser Colours

Need a central enum of "domains", so that { domain, cid } is unique

enum
{
  ColourCore = 1,
  ColourSidebar,
  ...
}

Then each library could number theirs from 0

Libraries would need to
- Register their colours
- Own / Init / Cleanup RegexColorList's
- cid -> RegexColorList lookup function
- Define their colours
  { "alias_name", MT_COLOR_ALIAS_NAME, OPTIONAL_REGEX, CASE_INSENSITIVE }
  or handle the parsing themselves
