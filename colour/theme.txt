Theme Colours

colours
	multiple domains per object (simple, palette, rgb)
	need linking together

parse deep colours, then *cull* on gui_init()

color object *link* object2  
use same linkage mechnism for multiple colour domains

arrange: object -> rgb -> palette -> simple
where are teh attrs stored? *separately*
if rgb isn't valid, nor are its attrs -- culled

if we *cull* them, then :color isn't useful
flag unusable colours instead
:color -> # not supported (instead of swatch)

~/.neomutt-theme
~/.config/neomutt/theme.rc

source! -- no fail
and/or
source *dir*  âˆ€ *.rc withing (alpha sorted)


if theme contains
	color x rgb     rgb
	color x palette palette
	color x simple  simple
and all three domains are supported
what happens when the user does?
	color x palette palette
result?
	overwrite just the palette?
	overwrite all?
		because it's interactive?
does DT_STARTUP allow stacking of colours?
then runtime if colour domain is allowed, overwrite all
what if the user sources a theme again?
