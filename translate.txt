Post-process PGP text
	Remove "[-- " and " --]" from translations
		needs double printf!
	Update code to insert them
	Accept multiline translations

change deploy script to commit *AS* the translator

webpage: sharing
	team notify and git

docs: ask to become a "contributor"

The cycle might look like:
- Commit to `translate` branch...
- Release date is announced
  - String freeze is in effect
  - `translate` branch is rebased and updated (`make update-po`)
  - Translators Team notified here
- Commit to `translate` branch...
- Release day
  - `translate` branch is rebased, updated and merged

may merge into master sooner if there are lots of commits to [translate]
or lots of changes to strings in master

document $1 cformat notation
	does this require code changes?

doc translate branch
	rebase & update ~1w before release

move scripts to management repo
add star by recently updated translations
	need to filter out commits that affect *.po
	e.g. sync translations to source

add notes about how to download the latest
file from the translation branch
(and how to make a PR?)

split up all multiline translated strings
	especially the copyright messages
	for easier translation and updating

change "L10N" comments to "TRANSLATORS:"
	(as that's the default)

script fuzzy / translation checker
	compare %-count syntax
	1300*30 ~ 40K compressed!

hooks in code to log most translated strings
	help translators prioritise their work

gettext logger to look for most used translations
	mark the common ones in the code

.po are "#: file.c" needed except at translate time?  drop?
	simplifies merges, etc
	line numbers are used by poedit app

issue label: "translation"

L10N split up large version string blocks

comments
	aka in lang
	function names
	"oppenc" meaning
	glossary
		alias
		thread = x
	comments ∀ translators
	mnemonic letters
	functions calls, uname(1)
	L10N dotfill
		to/from/subject
		translate?
	L10N optional?
	plurals
	multiple %s
	don't need .mo

web translate
	have anchors for each language
	they highlight that line

check git logs for translators' names / dates
tidy all headers

use google translate for rough drafts of neo po files?
	mark all translations as fuzzy
	useful starting place?

docs - how to transition to neo - list config options
	mutt-only
	neo-additions

guarantee translations, when?
	at release of new feature?
	at next release?
	when?

branch - pull, work, push
	even if WIP
	NO, that would break updates for all others

tips to web
	new section?

cut'n'paste notes
	grep, cat

poedit settings
	suggest disable wrapping -> web instructions

messages/layout of neo
	∀ languages

doc translation plan
	start in sync
	code and translate diverge
	sync after big changes
	sync 1 week before release

Most translation messages that are questions (to prompt the user)
	have trailing whitespace -- nuisance for the translator
	kill them, adjust code

frequently merge master INTO translate?
	would encourage frequent "make update-po"!

translate: eliminate "\n" from strings where possible?

mention translation team on translate page

translation - coding, scripting, languages

when updating/syncing
	de-wrap
	delete #~ (old)

style guide - can't vs cannot, etc
trans info from _("") cmdline (keep which lines?)
trans: warning/error prefix?  what about RTL languages?
rules, always pull before starting work
msgattrib --only-fuzzy de.po
msgattrib --untranslated de.po
	how to merge the result?
msgcat --use-first new.po old.po

trans scripts to management, inc msggrep for questions
update all copyright translations

[translate] PR - no webpush
