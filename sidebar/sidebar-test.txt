Yes!
Now that the calc and drawing have been separated, it should be easier to make more functions state-less.

Ultimately, `recalc()` takes some data: Account/Mailbox, some config and it fills in some other data structures.

Test cases would be wonderful.

To make them versatile (and user-friendly), I'd like the data and results to be in files, rather than hard-coded.
Imagine:
**test1.txt**
```
account Apple path
  mailbox Banana path emails:42 new:1 flagged:2
  ...
```

**config1.txt**
```
set sidebar_format = "..."
...
```

**results1.txt**
```
Apple
  Banana  [2]/1/42
```

However, there are some practical issues.
We want to test the non-gui parts of a gui component, without bringing in all the gui build dependencies.
`mutt_expando_format()` is particularly problematic.
