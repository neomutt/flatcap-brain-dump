index dlg data
	current A, M, E
	notify
	functions to set current A, M, E

sidebar
	function for events (simple)

init-windows -> sb_init(sb_win)
shutdow-windows -> sb_shutdown(sb_win)

sb_init - assume global N
	generate SB_AV-MV tree
	listen to:
		N for A|M changes
		N for config, colour, etc
		Dlg for change to current A|M
	flag: need_reflow, need_recalc, need_repaint

is need_reflow a thing?
	yes: if I change visibility

after init, main loop

reflow everything (force) - for initial run
	reflow (sb_win) - dimensions change -> notify sb
		sb already waiting for recalc, so do nothing

recalc everything (force) - for initial run
	sb_win.recalc() - generate format strings for on-screen lines
		flag need_repaint (already set)

repaint everything (force) - for initial run
	sb_win.repaint() - format strings to screen

change lists to arrays for sorting
does list in clude A or just M?
are A visible?  A displays spoolfile?
does sort include A, or just sort with A-scope?
deleting A/M offscreen won't affect display
sb account line - empty or spoolfile or cumulative total âˆ€ M?
A option - hidden, visible, collapsed?  new_only -> no visible M => no visible A?
late introduction of sidebar -- need to change orientation of dlg
sidebar integration: window, config, commands, colours, functions, sorts
