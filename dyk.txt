$index_format dates
	there are three formats:
	${...} time email was sent in senders timezone
	$[...] time email was sent in *your* timezone
	$(...) time email was received in *your* timezone
	https://neomutt.org/guide/reference.html#index-format

<grummund>
	Can a folder hook supply the pathname of the mail folder to a shell command it calls out to?
	something like...  folder-hook lists/* 'set from = `script.sh $dir`@example.com'
<kevin8t8>
	you can set an environment variable that you reference from the script.
	folder-hook . 'set visual=^'
	folder-hook . 'setenv MYCURFOLDER $visual'
	this assumes you aren't using $visual for anything, and uses the folder
	shortcut '^' to get the current folder with path variable expansion.
	then assigns it to the envvar of your choice.

msg ranges, relative, ^, $, .

folder-hook =trash             'push <delete-pattern>~d>30d<enter>'

about index_format padding: `... %s%> (%c)` vs `... %s%* (%c)`
	which of subject vs ending (%c) gets priority in a low-space situation
	and generally min/max widths and left/right justification

autodiscovery of maildir
	mailboxes `find ~/mail -type d -name cur -printf "%h\n"`

set index_format="%4C %-12@date@ %-15.15F %Z (%4c) %s"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1H"    "just now"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<2H"    "an hour ago"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<4H"    "few hours ago"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1d"    "earlier today"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<2d"    "yesterday"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<7d"    "this week"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1m"    "%[%a %d]"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1y"    "%[%b %d]"
index-format-hook  date  "~A"       "%[%m/%y]"

DYK -> github "announce" discussion!

promote gist to DYK
	https://gist.github.com/flatcap/bd9105208b016ae39ed253f95d94e808
	for the perfect example, you'd wrap the "on" case with <tag-prefix-cond> ... <end-cond>, to be a no-op when there are zero tagged files
	add comments
	space before command to prevent history (separate DYK)

add?
	# abort_noattach = yes
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(attach|attached|attachments?)\\>"
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(bijvoegen|bijgevoegd|bijlage|bijlagen)\\>"
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(anhängen|angehängt|anhang|anhänge|hängt an)\\>"
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(attaché|attachés|attache|attachons|joint|jointe|joints|jointes|joins|joignons)\\>"
