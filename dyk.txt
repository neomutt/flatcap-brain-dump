easy task python
	neo-bot (rename repo)
	modernise neo-bot
	dyk036 -> title + url

/dyk/001 (1000)
	date in header? YES
	or sort by number? YES

repo for issues/ideas
	do we need a repo?  no files?
	use website issues
	add issue templates

section on website + reverse date table
	link to latest on home page

set variables from variables: status_format="... ${from} ..."

subject editing [devel] etc
	with examples for our two mailing lists

text vs gui
	mailcap, copiousoutput, auto_view

associate mailto: link with neomutt
	see https://gist.github.com/flatcap/a1c94399c40893db39d641fb106a0dc2
	contents of ~/desktop

autocmd BufRead /tmp/mutt/neomutt-* setl syntax=mail ts=8 sw=2 et

jump to first blank line (after headers)

# vim: syntax=neomuttrc

alias add # comments

:<space>command  (won't show up in history)

$index_format dates
	there are three formats:
	${...} time email was sent in senders timezone
	$[...] time email was sent in *your* timezone
	$(...) time email was received in *your* timezone
	https://neomutt.org/guide/reference.html#index-format
	the ... is strftime() compatible letters ("man strftime" in a terminal will document them)

<grummund>
	Can a folder hook supply the pathname of the mail folder to a shell command it calls out to?
	something like...  folder-hook lists/* 'set from = `script.sh $dir`@example.com'
<kevin8t8>
	you can set an environment variable that you reference from the script.
	folder-hook . 'set visual=^'
	folder-hook . 'setenv MYCURFOLDER $visual'
	this assumes you aren't using $visual for anything, and uses the folder
	shortcut '^' to get the current folder with path variable expansion.
	then assigns it to the envvar of your choice.

msg ranges, relative, ^, $, .

folder-hook =trash             'push <delete-pattern>~d>30d<enter>'

about index_format padding: `... %s%> (%c)` vs `... %s%* (%c)`
	which of subject vs ending (%c) gets priority in a low-space situation
	and generally min/max widths and left/right justification

autodiscovery of maildir
	mailboxes `find ~/mail -type d -name cur -printf "%h\n"`

set index_format="%4C %-12@date@ %-15.15F %Z (%4c) %s"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1H"    "just now"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<2H"    "an hour ago"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<4H"    "few hours ago"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1d"    "earlier today"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<2d"    "yesterday"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<7d"    "this week"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1m"    "%[%a %d]"
index-format-hook  date  "~d<1y"    "%[%b %d]"
index-format-hook  date  "~A"       "%[%m/%y]"

DYK -> github "announce" discussion!

promote gist to DYK
	https://gist.github.com/flatcap/bd9105208b016ae39ed253f95d94e808
	for the perfect example, you'd wrap the "on" case with <tag-prefix-cond> ... <end-cond>, to be a no-op when there are zero tagged files
	add comments
	space before command to prevent history (separate DYK)

add?
	# abort_noattach = yes
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(attach|attached|attachments?)\\>"
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(bijvoegen|bijgevoegd|bijlage|bijlagen)\\>"
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(anh√§ngen|angeh√§ngt|anhang|anh√§nge|h√§ngt an)\\>"
	# set attach_keyword = "\\<(attach√©|attach√©s|attache|attachons|joint|jointe|joints|jointes|joins|joignons)\\>"

sending a file "apple.txt"

fake/external new mail command
	zsw: if using linux, there's incrond for firing off a command/script when a dir is touched

position cursor in input field, e.g.
	macro index <F5> '<limit>-I ""<left>'

:bind index p end-cond
# make 'p' do nothing, silently, on the index

RSI prevention, NeoMutt style:

alberand | Hey all! Does anyone know if there is an easy way to change received emails? What I want to do is - I get a lot Jira emails and they contains
         | a bunch of useless info, I want to add bash script on those emails to cut this off
 flatcap | yes, you could use $display_filter
 flatcap | :set display_filter="sed '/^On/,/^$/d'"
 flatcap | that'd kill everything between a line beginning "On" and the first blank line after it
 flatcap | you could use a couple of `folder-hook`s to make it only apply on certain folders

#mutt
It would be nice to have the "color status" changed for the different mail boxes. Can this be achieved?
create folder-hook example

howto re-send automatic emails / template
	see irc discussion on 2023-11-03

example conditional date for "today", "this week", "this month"
set index_format = "%<[d?%[Today %R]&%[%F %R]>"

disable 'p' (print) by binding the key to nop or endcond
	check/test

subjectrx
	subject lines like "Re: AW: WG: Fwd: AW: Re: AG Live Scoring" are common. Can
	subjectrx '((aw|fwd|re|wg): )*' 're: %R'
	strips multiple re: aw: etc
	reducing your example to just "re: AG Live Scoring"
	(the re: being inserted by choice)
	---
	subjectrx '\[neomutt/neomutt\] Run failed: (.*) (\(\x+\))' '‚úÖ [%2] %1'

use toggle on numbers
	e.g macro to toggle full-screen mode
	:toggle sidebar_visible pager_index_lines
