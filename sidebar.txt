Sidebar 2

Need top-level SOURCEs: Mail, Notmuch, NNTP, Address book, RSS?

Either separate modes: one or other SRC
One open, others listed at bottom (folded)
Full folder metaphor: user controls what's visible
	=> could need ability to "limit" folders/entries to manage size

Mail SRC represents each mail source: Local, POP3, IMAP, etc
	user can have multiple of any SRC
	inc. multitple email accounts
	     multitple address books, etc

Use 2nd divider character for horizontal separator
	or drop completely and use a bool: ASCII vs Unicode
	and draw the lines properly

=> No more sidebar_format... need:
	sb_mail_format
	sb_notmuch_format
	sb_nntp_format
	sb_addressbook_format
	sb_rss_format

Full office suite -- manage anything texty

SRC: Address book
	backend: files, db, ldap, google
	integrated with email: "add to address book", "complete from address book"

SRC: Calendar
	backend? files, db, ldap, google
	brief calendar in sidebar
	expanded work area in main panel
	integrated with email: e.g. "create event from email (scan for dates)"

SRC: tasks
	backend: files, db, ldap, google
	integrated with email: e.g. "turn email into task"

fewer sidebar_ variables
	width
	divider_chars
rest are SRC-dependent

∀ SRCn::init() call sb_register_source (name, callbacks)
sidebar function sb_select_source(name)

SRC provides sb with list of MAILBOXs
	who provides the sorting?
	different SRCs will have different requirements
sb displays, paginates, delegates open to SRC

src_mailboxes
src_addresses
src_notmuch	or src_searching
src_calendar
src_rss

functions: curs_main -> sb -> SRCx, SRCy, SRCz

SRC: Calendar
	sb displays: day, week, n-week, month, n-month, year
	functions: page up/down dependent on view
		next/prev - day, week, etc
		goto date
		search event
	mail panel - grid view, agenda view => panel manager (cal_panel)
	tie in calendar to addressbook: birthdays, anniversaries, etc

SRC: Addresses
	sb displays - categories/tags, search results, etc
	main panel displays full records, or contents of selected category
	categories/tags can be expanded in sb
	people can be in multiple/zero categories/tags -- need top-level for unclassified people
	src_add could need extra panel
		sb1: tags
		sb2: list of tagged people
		sb3: selected person

sidebar option to toggle subscribed folders
	=> keep all unsub'd folders
	what about nntp -> 32K on gmane

sidebar intro 'support +sidebar'!

sidebar abbreviation option
	/apple/banana/cherry/folder becomes
	/a/b/c/folder

should the current folder show up in the sidebar
	even if it's not mailboxes'd?
	nice!
	then disappear when de-selected?
	allow the user to 'subscribe' to it to keep it
	allow the user to 'unsubscribe' from any folder
		temporarily gone (till end of the session)
	should this be:
		<sidebar-subscribe>
		<sidebar-unsubscribe>
	or
		<subscribe-folder>
		<unsubscribe-folder>

sidebar
	colours using patterns? ~N ~F
	colours for spool, trash, postpone?

sidebar commands <next-sibling>, <prev-sibling>, <parent-folder>

sidebar/account option - toggle-subscribed (folders)
view:
	just <mailboxes>
	subscribed
	all

auto-sidebar bool option -- hide until needed on
	<sidebar-show>
	<sidebar-up>/<sidebar-down>
	hide until needed
	hide on <sidebar-open>
	or after 1 second if possible

sidebar intro -- mention "mailboxes" command

sidebar_account colour?

sidebar intro
	priority of colours may be wrong after upstream changes
	https://www.neomutt.org/feature/sidebar-intro#intro-sidebar-colors

move sidebar-intro to howto and fix links
	change id to howto/
	or split out completely

sidebar -- disable indent, etc if sorted

new sidebar expando
	count of unread *threads*

fold/collapse empty sidebar folders
	unless unread/flagged email etc

sidebar
	separate colour for read-only mailbox
	expando for read-only mailbox

sidebar
	option to fold nested mailboxes
	option to unfold when new mail arrives
	folded, they should show the cumulative totals for all the children
	colour for folded?

revert sidebar cursor positioning?
	no longer needed now that sidebar isn't drawn during key-waits

sidebar search command to quickly change to a mailbox
	like vim highlight search?
	filter after every keystroke

sidebar-refresh command to forcibly update ALL the counts?

sb fill empty space -> mutt_paddstr
	no point, it just does multiple addch(' ')
	alloc buffer (on stack)
	memset to ' ', null at width, addstr()

<sidebar-next-new> => $sidebar_flagged_are_new ?

set/unset sidebar_visible doesn't refresh screen when in pager
sb doesn't match folder (for open) if it has a trailing /

<sidebar-refresh> function to forcibly refresh screen & counts after, e.g.
	unmailboxes *
	mailboxes lots...

sidebar, when saving email to a folder use the sidebar as a selector?
	new indicator colour or prompts "select save folder" + normal highlight

what does Sidebar *really* need?
	Incoming MAILBOX -> notifications of MAILBOX changes
	Panel (geometry) -> notifications of WINCH
	character libraries -> lengths, widths, formatting, etc
	options (config access)
	colours
	curses: clear(panel), clear(line), write (char/string), move(x,y)
		curses calls are all (0,0)-based
		curses takes panel object and converts to screen coordinates
		∀ users
	callbacks for functions
	sb is initialised with (Panel pointer), notifications on change
	can query Panel's size, position (not useful), visibility
	panel can be visible, but !active, e.g. partially under a modal dialog
		=> paint if asked, but won't receive keys
		could still be asked to do stuff by dialog, etc

sidebar indented folders
	fill in gaps in hierarchy automatically
	make them non-selectable (unless the user has "mailboxes" them)
	alternatively, have some way to mark mailboxes as "fake"
		probably a horrible idea

separate draw() in sidebar for
	emails
	notmuch
	nntp
	addressbook?

use sort_aux for nested sidebar names?
	no, sub-folders are same type?
		no
	YES: allows to sort by name, then subsort by new-count
	separate variable otherwise it interferes with index, etc

cache sidebar formatted strings on Mailbox object?

Alternate views in the sidebar
	need toggle function
	imap: folders  <--> dir tree
	local: folders <--> dir browser

sb extra colours for:
	readonly mailboxes
		expando?
	bad (non-existent) mailboxes
		expando?
	virtual mailboxes
	what other attrs?
	colour by SRC
	separate colour schemes by SRC?

sidebar needs NO-selection possibility for toggle-virtual

sb expandos
	compare letters to status_format letters
	deleted?
	number after limiting
	unread?

sidebar expandos
	%c number of non-deleted emails (total - deleted)
	%s = %c? (lower case version of %S?)

can the real status bar display any sidebar fields?
	why not?
	how can they be integrated?

tree chars for sidebar hierarchy?

draw sidebar
	assumes position/size
	move due to STATUSONTOP, HELP
	check of show/hidden has changed & refresh numbers if nec
	if hidden, do nothing
	sanity check settings
	draw divider (3 chars!)
for all buffers
	set colour
	move
	gen displayname (need to cache this)
		name, bytelen, screenlen
		what about config changes
			including sort order
	make sidebar_entry
fill remaining lines with blanks

Sidebar actions (that might precipitate change):
	line-up
	line-down
	page-up
	page-down
	set mailbox from browser
	change sort order
	add mailbox
	delete mailbox
	change mailbox's sort criteria (e.g. flag an email, a flagged-sorted mailbox)
	resize window
	hide sidebar
	show sidebar
	open folder

sb_draw should return success of drawing
	possible given all the callbacks, etc?

sidebar_width = auto (size to contents)
	would need to parse and format all strings ahead of drawing divider

possible to fix sidebar sort order to respect hierarchy/indentation?

need attention
	draw_sidebar
	OPTSIDEBARSORT
		sorts by real path, not visible name

sidebar_dividers
	first (wide) character is vertical divider
		between sidebar and index/pager
	second (wide) character is horizontal divider
		between different mailboxes (within the sidebar)

overline between A's?

It's almost like we need a pattern to control what to display:
sidebar_display = "~N | ~O | ~F | (~J > 0)"
(~J = message count -- not implemented)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

function, config, mbox_close, colour, pagercmd, indexcmd, indexwin, cmdparse, cmd
	mbox_check 38

Event Window (N-level for Index Dialog)
	Account	alters wdata, flags win!
	Mailbox alters wdata, flags win!
	Colour flag win, colours global
	Command flag win, acts on global
	Window? flag win, *only* our dialog
		*only* when visible
	Dialog? Current-M-changed -> flag win

divider needs to be a Window
	what about dragging it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

one calc & draw are separated, add tests
function to turn string list into A/M tree,
then calc and turn back into string for checking
paths, descriptions, $folder, $sb_X
config needs parameterising
folder names need to be separate from format string calculation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

top, opn, hil, bot

sidebar - all config is global (N)?
	save and use wdata->sub
create wdata N->sub, observers, get initial M-list
recalc() uses wdata: MVL calc window bounds
∀ M format entry: pass M, width, calc indent, gen indent string, gen colour
put fixed string & colour in wdata
recalc(win) - win_is_visible() (contract: only calc visible?)
shortcut if 0 Mailboxes (check 0 width, 0 height?) -> page_size
calc visibility ∀ M, cfg, whitelist; sort entries, cfg
reframe hilight on screen; ∀ SBEntry: select colour
abbrev, calc depth

floating sidebar (on right)
	hovers over index
