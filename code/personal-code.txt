personal taste

These changes aren't an official Mutt guideline, they're my personal
preferences.  I find them easier/quicker to read/understand.

Prefer:
    if (x == 3)
Rather than:
    if (3 == x)

I like ()s around any logic that has more than one token.

These simple tokens are OK:
    if (!x || !y)

Prefer:
    if ((x == 3) && (y == 2))
Rather than:
    if (x == 3 && y == 2)
