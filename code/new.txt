code style:
	while (condition)
	  ;
	need something for clarity?
	{} instead?
	; // Do nothing?
	enforce blank line after?

c++ build fix reserved names
	see code.txt

whitespace
	indenting, etc
commenting
static function
confusing tests like
	if (!x->deleted)
	imply deleted is a BOOL
some macros use multiple statements separated by comma
	change to { X; Y; Z; } while(0)
unify #if/#ifdef HAVE_X/USE_X
clearly mark empty for loops
	/* nothing */
sort definitions
	vars, functions
static functions first
check all string config vars are NONULL'd
check ALL pointers
reorder functions to reduce forward function declarations
forward declare structs in headers to reduce includes

code: C99, POSIX:2001

code: if (!x) {} else {}
	swap order

code: every .c has "config.h"
	(layout)

look for ternary conditions starting:  !x ? y : z

for non-trivial structs create both X_new() and X_free() functions
