# Introduction

NeoMutt has lots of documentation, but it's encyclopaedic and heavy reading.
We want to collect a large number of simple tips for beginners.
This is our "Did You Know?" (DYK) idea.

## Work So Far

The `dyk/` directory contains some sorted ideas (numbered 001 to 015) and some unsorted in `dyk.txt`.

## Tasks

- Read through the existing tips
- Read the rest of the repository
  DO NOT READ the `work-files` directory
- Suggest other simple tips for beginners
