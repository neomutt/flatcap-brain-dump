DYK 023 — Understand index_format time tokens

There are three useful time expansions for index_format:
- ${...} — time the email was sent in the sender's timezone
- $[...] — time the email was sent in your timezone
- $(...) — time the email was received in your timezone
Use strftime() format letters inside the brackets; see the reference for examples.
