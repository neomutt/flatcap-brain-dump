DYK 020 — Detect missing attachments automatically

Use attach_keyword together with abort_noattach to warn about missing attachments when composing. Example:
set attach_keyword = "\\<(attach|attached|attachment|attached files?)\\>"
set abort_noattach = yes
This helps avoid trips where you mention an attachment but forget to add it.
