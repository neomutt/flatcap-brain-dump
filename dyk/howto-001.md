Howto 001 — Multiple profiles/accounts

Split per-account settings into files (account-1.rc, account-2.rc) and create small macros to source them. Show required variables (from, sendmail, smtp), a shortcut macro to switch profiles, and tips to avoid leaking settings across profiles (reset values you change). Include example file layout and recommended status_format to show active profile.
