Subject: An Holistic Solution for Help

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: Richard Russon
To: Floyd Anderson

Many months ago, I came up with a global solution for Help in NeoMutt.

- Help in markdown files (in a directory tree)
- Used to generate web pages
- Integrated into NeoMutt as a fake mailbox

When I hinted at it in Reis' issue you seemed interested (in the idea at
least).

- Create a new "help" mailbox type
  - Populate from a directory of markdown files
  - Enable searching of all files
  - Enable hyperlinks between pages

We'll need to convert the docs, too, but that can wait until we've
sorted out any technical problems.

Are you interested?

You are right, I'm always open to improve the docs, because I recall 
good enough how hard it was (at least for me) to understand Mutt's way 
of configuration, to search all those blogs for information, grabbing 
and test snippets from several public dot-files just to get a working 
configuration in the end.

Yes, absolutely. Even I'm not a developer and didn't know exactly where 
to start or how to implement some kind of 'neomutt://' pseudo protocol, 
you can count on me.

I 'only' need to know the final goal and what tasks needs to be done for 
it. I'll pick up one or the other and might be helpful. For instance, I 
like your last opened issues (tagged with 'good first issue' or 'help 
wanted' and/or 'mentor'), those makes the direction of the venture very 
clear to me.

That's great.  It's too sunny to be indoors :-)

For all of us.  (Neo)Mutt's hard to learn.  Changing the docs to be
task-oriented (with examples) would go a long way to helping beginners.

On the other side, I'm struggling to untangle the code, so that we can
add features like the 'account' command to simpify the config of
multiple accounts.

Thanks.  I should have done that ages ago.
That was stage one: motivate the developers.

Stage two (just notes), is to try to motivate all of NeoMutt's users.

One of the jobs is a "config curator".  There are millions of blogs,
many with great info, but all that wisdom needs to be cut'n'pasted into
our site.  We need to encourage people to be selfless -- contribute to
*our* website, not their own :-)

How good are your C skills?
- Strong: Give me some pointers of where to start
- OK: Create a framework and I'll fill in the gaps (with help)
- Not so good: I'll stick to the docs side

Yes, that was my first thought too when I saw the issues, but NeoMutt is 
on a good way. For example, some people at a Gentoo mailing list never 
heard of NeoMutt and were surprised of its "gaining traction", although 
there's a heavily patched regular Mutt. And who knows, maybe we hit the 
1000 stars and get a few new regular contributors until next year.

He, that'll be a long running target. In the past I saw many sites with 
the same tip/solution for something, but nearly no one mentioned the 
real source of it, because people tends to produce news by copy'n'paste 
as it were it their own stuff. But as I said, NeoMutt is on the way.

I wrote a person about how I like the easy way one can contribute to 
NeoMutt and got his confirmative response (Mutt endless discussion; 
NeoMutt just one structural style change and committed). OK, that may be 
a blue eyed example, but it happened and I saw it also in my case after 
you invited me to join the project. That (and a patient helping hand) 
really encourage to be selfless -- after some time people will say we 
instead of you and I.

Thanks for this 'checkbox' list style, it would be difficult to tell 
otherwise.  ;-)

Knowing the basics, I think I'm near your second point. When starting 
something from scratch -- I would be lost. Using existing code as 
reference to get an idea how to implement/improve other code is easier 
for me, but here we are at my main handicap -- I'm slow.

I want (and need) to get nearly always a complete overview to be able to 
make the right decision about the right way of doing things. I can spend 
hours and hours with searching for an alternative but optimised form of 
the same code. But that's OK for me, I learn more when testing not only 
the absolute necessary things.

Fabian (@grobian) is big in Gentoo and used to promote NeoMutt
Then one day cited philosophical differences and he went away.

For every useful, often-linked, site we need to be able to say:
Our guide has that info and it's up-to-date.

> I like the easy way one can contribute to NeoMutt

Indeed.  We take more risks, which occasionally backfire, but our
frequent releases mean things get fixed quickly, too.

Thanks.

Sorry, I read a lot of articles about project management.
One said to avoid open-ended questions, like: "What do you think?"

Great.

You and me, both :-)

Last night I spent a couple of hours creating a new mailbox type.
Branch: devel/help.  It's hacked together.  I'll try to fix it up this week.

For now, start looking at file/dir handling routines:
- How to read a directory (recursively)
  Have a look at the browser code
  https://neomutt.org/code/file.html
- How to parse lines of text
  Look at the parse_*() routines in init.c
  https://neomutt.org/code/string.html

I've also created a test-doc repo with a lot of sample markdown files.
They have a yaml header (which includes metadata) and are interlinked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>It doesn't do much, but it works now.

Frankly, I feel stupid because I tried hard to figure out how it works, 
without luck. I fear my knowledge is insufficient and/or I'm missing an 
important step/point, thus I need your help -- once again.

Firstly, branch devel/help compiles fine. In my case, I partially revert
[doxygen: add headers and links](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/2c6ff878865f48d84660df7511009421dd2929c0#diff-8abaf063c6aa4baacba439344cfff1c9)
and do: '#include "hcversion.h"' -> '#include "hcache/hcversion.h"', in 
hcache/hcache.c to prevent:

  fatal error: hcversion.h: No such file or directory
  #include "hcversion.h"
           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  compilation terminated.

Because I do not compile in $(SRCDIR), i.e. in the repo root. I like to 
separate the different branch builds in a Git-ignored subdirectory.

Anyway, after looking into the code, it seems to me that all is there to 
handle a folder as help mailbox. My assumption therefore was to create a 
folder, define it as format type help within NeoMutt (or a config file) 
and put some (pseudo-)documents (probably from test-doc repo) in there.

Now my questions:

What do you exactly mean with "it works now", i.e. what works? How can I 
define a help folder/mailbox (empty or not) that NeoMutt will recognise, 
so I get some output from the 'mutt_debug(1, "entering help_*\n");' 
calls in help/help.c? Did I misunderstood your implementation start of a 
help system?

I hope I expressed my problem clear and short enough (I won't confront a 
'helping hand' with walls of text). Thanks in advance.

To: Floyd Anderson

> > > Branch: devel/help
>  #include "hcversion.h"

Ah, sorry about that.  That was a bug that I briefly introduced and
fixed.  The branch has been rebased and should build cleanly.

> > It doesn't do much, but it works now.

> I feel stupid because I tried hard to figure out how it works,

Don't.  The mailbox code is a mess.

Our docs are going to live in `/usr/share/doc/neomutt/help`.  This will
be our "$folder" directory.  We'll use a URL of "help://" to reference
files (ignoring the .md suffix).

In NeoMutt: <change-folder>help://sidebar<enter>

NeoMutt calls: mx_open_mailbox("help://sidebar")

The mailbox is a multiplexor.  The mailbox type determines which
function it calls:
    mx_open() -> imap_open()
              -> maildor_open()
              -> help_open()

# Identify the mailbox type
mx_open_mailbox() calls
    mx_get_magic() calls
        mx_is_help() calls
            url_check_scheme() which checks
                UrlMap[]
MUTT_HELP is returned

# Get the set of functions for that mailbox type
mx_open_mailbox() calls
    mx_get_ops()
mx_help_ops is returned

There's quite a lot of hard-coding to "create" a new mailbox type.

# Open the mailbox
mx_open_mailbox() calls
    help_open()

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What do you exactly mean with "it works now"

In business terms, you've got a vertical slice.

You haven't just got some sample code, you've got a framework that you
can put code into and actually run it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what the sample code does.

When help_open() is called, we're expected to provide a list of "emails".
For each email, we create a `struct Header` which contains a
`struct Envelope` and a `struct Body`.  The Headers are added to the
Context's header list `hdrs`.

We create 10 of these with some sample data in them.
Returning, NeoMutt displays these emails in the index.

When we click on one, NeoMutt calls mx_open_message() which is delegated
to help_open_msg().  mx_open_message() is expecting a `FILE*` in return
that has the email data.  As we don't have any real files, we create a
temp file and fill it with data.

When we leave the pager, mx_close_message() calls help_close_msg(),
which closes the `FILE*`.

When we leave the mailbox, mx_close_mailbox() calls help_close()

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what your code will do.

help_open() will discover the help files -- look through the directory
for `*.md`.  (Don't worry about recursion, yet).

For each file, we will create an "email".  To start with, we can make up
the header info.  Later, we'll parse the yaml header.

When help_open_msg() is called, we open the file and return the handle.
On help_close_msg() we close the handle.

At this point, you can view help files, limit by the "subject"
(filename) and possibly do "~b" body searches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I won't confront a 'helping hand' with walls of text

That's not a problem.  Ask lots of questions.  The more I explain it,
the better I understand it and the easier it'll be to fix it (when I
have some of that mythical "free time" :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: Floyd Anderson
To: Richard Russon

I just want you to know, I got it, *yes*  :-)
and of course say: thank you very much for your really useful detailed 
explanation, task descriptions and that you took the time for it/me.

>We'll use a URL of "help://" to reference files
>In NeoMutt: <change-folder>help://sidebar<enter>

I wouldn't have found it without you, even I was close at it and tried 
'mailboxes help:///path/to/dir' and '<change-folder>=help:///path/to/dir'
afterwards.

>The mailbox code is a mess.

Really? You're pressure and scaring me -- just kidding.

>Ask lots of questions. The more I explain it, the better I understand 
>it and the easier it'll be to fix it (when I have some of that mythical

Nice principle, although I'll try not to stress that mythical shy being 
too much. However, now I can switch my brain mode and will look into the 
tasks. Thanks again.

From: Floyd Anderson
To: Richard Russon

first things first, sorry for the delay without any status update. In 
the past two weeks I'm reading, debugging the code to refresh my spare 
knowledge and try to accumulate it. There're still so much things to 
learn and understand, my thanks and respect for you and your work and 
all the other contributors are still growing.

>How are things going?

The 'tasks' are functional working and partially documented, but I'm 
currently unsatisfied with it. That means:
  -- Invoking '<change-folder>help://' or hitting '<Esc>H', will show
    a listing of all (probably) valid Markdown (MD) files in the index.
    The help mailbox will be open read-only.
  - A newly implemented 'help_doc_dir' option defaults to directory
    'PKGDOCDIR "/help"' (globally HelpDocDir), where NeoMutt search
    recursively for MD files with a proper extension and a YAML header
  - hitting '<Enter>' shows the current MD file (with YAML header)
  - limiting/searching also works

Things I don't like or that I cannot or haven't solved until now:
  - My idea is to have one root help(mail)box with several sub-helpboxes
    for chapter and section directories
  - The way to invoke help. I would like to show the directories (under
    HelpDocDir) as help mailboxes categorised as:
        helpbox -> chapter -> section (includes all deeper nested docs)
    when I enter '?' for a list of helpboxes
  - It would be nice if NeoMutt with '<change-folder>help://sidebar'
    would jump directly to section-directory/helpbox 'sidebar' in
    chapter-dir/box 'feature' -> 'HelpDocDir "feature/sidebar"'
  - The <change-folder> prompt should be deleted after the first key
    press and all following input should be treated as a helpbox, so I
    doesn't have to type 'help://' all the time. Currently that can be
    achieved by hitting <BackSpace> but feels not naturally
  - Some systems (like Gentoo) may bzip2 compress all docs under:
        "/usr/share/doc/neomutt(-20180512)/"
    on install time. On Gentoo, that can be solved with the ebuild, but
    I don't know what other distributions do.

Things I cannot find an appropriate answer for from the code/docs:
  - How long should a file system path string be initialised?:
        char buf[_POSIX_PATH_MAX, PATH_MAX, LONG_STRING];
    Background is [1] <https://eklitzke.org/path-max-is-tricky>.
  - Is there a rule of thumb when to FREE what?
  - Aside that I cannot find the right point in the code where I can
    hook into to get a nice help mailbox listing (probably threaded),
    I'm unsure which data structure to use to store the MD file list.
    I tried an array of pointers, Buffy structure (because browser.c use
    it a lot). Currently I'm using a STAILQ list for helpbox/helpdoc
    (directories and MD files).

I have more to ask but will stop here for now because it stays very 
theoretical without code. Rich, I think I need two more days to clean 
out my failed and commented changes and for the remaining remarks and 
for documentation and just rethinking. Should I push my trial (to 
devel/help or in a new branch) then? Would you like to see a patch?

Sorry for this long response, I hope you'll see my points, but I'm sure 
I forgot a bunch of questions, that came up the past week(s).

P.S.: Please, can you write me your idea of how the MD files should be 
displayed (without an email- but with a YAML-header)? Should the format
of the index and the menu in pager view be changed for helpboxes? Should 
a helpbox shortcut (similar to + and =) be implemented? OK, I stop now. 
:-)

Wow, you *have* been busy!

>    for chapter and section directories

Yep.  So, each directory has, say, `index.md` which is displayed when
the directory is referenced without a file.  The index file lists (and
links to) all the subdirs (subsections).

All these lists will be written by humans, rather than auto-generated.

Yes, a set of nested "emails".  For that we need MuttThread.
Context->hdrs[] a list of all the "emails" in order.  Each Header has a
MuttThread which links them in a hierarchy.  I haven't experimented with
this yet, so you'll have to show me how it's done :-)

For that we need an index.
There are lots of possibilities here: text, json, csv, sqlite.
As the help files are static, we could have an install script to
(re-)generate it.

Words in various places in the help files will have different weightings.
Searching for "sidebar" should match:
1. Chapter Title
2. Metadata
3. Body text
4. Links to the above

Hmm... That's an interesting one.  We'd almost want a new behaviour:

Current folder:   imap://host.com/folder/subfolder
Hit <backspace>:  imap://host.com/
Hit <backspace>:  [EMPTY]

Current folder:   help://sidebar/sorting
Hit <backspace>:  help://
Hit <backspace>:  [EMPTY]

Hmm... where does search fit in?

    help://?something

>  - Some systems (like Gentoo) may bzip2 compress all docs under:

Hmm... that's a little anti-social.
I think we'll have to insist on plain text.
Fedora automatically compresses man pages, but nothing else.

>  - How long should a file system path string be initialised?:

Today, PATH_MAX (4096).  Tomorrow, NEO_PATH (4096).  See:
    https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/1229

> I'm unsure which data structure to use to store the MD file list.

To start with, I wouldn't bother caching the file list.  There aren't
many files and it'll be quick to regenerate.  Store everything we need
in the Header/Envelope.  Link them all with MuttThread.

> I need two more days ...
> Should I push my trial (to devel/help or in a new branch)

Push it to devel/help

> Should the format of the index and the menu in pager view be changed for helpboxes?

Yes, we'll need $help_index_format
It probably won't need many expandos.

> Should a helpbox shortcut (similar to + and =) be implemented? OK, I stop now. :-)

Yes.  We should have a fake $folder for the help root dir (eventually).
Due to limitations of the mailbox API, some of the code will be in mx.c

I'm already there, even if I lost myself several times while diving into 
the code every single day. Oh man, I'm a bad contributor and the time is 
running so fast. I have not even checked the GitHub repo the past three 
weeks nor the new version. On the other side, I've never knew more about 
NeoMutt's internals than now.

After your last mail I better had pushed my work, but I tried to achieve
the linking with MuttThread instead and don't wanted to push half-baked 
things. That drives me crazy, because of trouble with my STAILQ list. I 
could not do sorting, it was in reverse order and macro STAILQ_LAST (to 
get a previous processed/parent object) always failed due to the 
underlying QUEUE_TYPEOF macro - code compiles but crashed afterwards.

Anyway, now I use a generic list for several objects, which works as I 
want, but honestly, it feels a little bit like unnecessary bloating the 
code. Nevertheless, I hope I'm on the right way.

Following works here so far (tested with a cloned neomutt.github.io and 
test-doc repo and additional nested sub-directories -- some empty, others 
with a mix of valid and invalid files (with BOM signature, wrong YAML 
header with incomplete/badly formatted markers/keywords, bad file name, 
like "/path/to/.md", etc.):
  - when NeoMutt starts, the new $help_doc_dir option is set by default
    to "PKGDOCDIR/help" and function <help-box> is bound to "<Esc>H"
  - set $help_doc_dir to an appropriate directory path if necessary and
    pressing the shortcut or execute <help-box> directly or indirectly
    through <change-folder>, pre-fills the prompt with "help://" string
  - now press <Enter> to open the "helpbox" or press an arrow key (to 
    avoid deletion of the help URI) and specify a path fragment of an
    existing file/folder (relative to $help_doc_dir), like:
        help://panel/i[ndex.md]
  - NeoMutt will show the chapter/section threads in its index view
  - "help/help.c" source file provides hard-coded "options":
      - HELP_CACHE_DOCLIST    ... to cache the list of documents
      - HELP_LINK_CHAPTERS    ... to uplink chapters into helpbox

What isn't implemented/doesn't work yet:
  - pressing "?" at command prompt for list of helpbox chapter/sections
  - sorting chapter/section related to file header keywords
  - show up a help folder in sidebar
  - completion of chapter/section in command prompt
  - a $help_index_format and a suitable help menu
  - ...

I pushed my first steps to a Help system to devel/help and rebased the 
branch. Rich, even it was a lot of stuff to deal with for me so far, do 
not hesitate to lacerate me and my code. I want to learn the right way.

Thank you for your code docs, for being patient and apologise my delay -- 
I was really immersed in the code and sometimes dreamed about and in C.

P.S. While my rebase, I noticed different buffer sizes related to 
DT_PATH in init.c file. Am I wrong or should those:

  - <https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/833b37df10025c7bac84b42bb496607a7204f2b5/init.c#L2121>

better use PATH_MAX? Additionally I saw:

  - <https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/b8466bf029ea6ec1c409c65b75e6b7a1820b9635/init.h#L2285>

in init.h file, that use 1 instead of true and talks about "mutt" 
instead of "NeoMutt".

Yes, I've been standardising things and tidying.
It's important to do, but can make merging/rebasing a pain.
I'll check the code is ok.

The help code seemed to be on a parallel (but identical) set of commits.

I've merged your typo fix, run clang-format, rebased and pushed the
branch.  You'll need to reset your local branch.

It's looking good!  More to come.

I've read through the code and run it through the debugger.
I traced a file from disk to screen -- it's a complicated journey!

I made a lot of notes.

First an apology.  I suggested that you use the browser as a model.
It turns out it's not a great example.  There's a better way using nftw()
This function does most of the work for you.

This example is from the man page:
    https://pastebin.com/QQjsvudg

I also suggest that you split up the code.

First, I'd factor out the filesystem code -- helpdir.[ch] -- create
function(s) that recurse through a directory and store the results in
NON-neomutt structures.  This function just needs to identify
directories and markdown files, and put them into a tree structure.

Its only dependencies will be libmutt.a (our shared lib).

The next bit of code turns that tree into Header/Thread/Envelope.
These structs aren't quite independent of NeoMutt.  When they are,
(soon), this code could be tested too.

Rather than overwhelm you with hundreds of crazy ideas, I'll stop now.

this is just a short response from me. I'll have a closer look to your 
notes this evening and formulate my questions then.

Thank you for looking into my commit and your remarks -- especially for 
pointing out the nftw() function. I didn't knew it and searching for 
"tree"/"walk" keywords, which is obviously now, doesn't came to my mind.

I've given them a tidy.  Most of them you already know -- I've just
talked them through for my own clarification.

Also, have a think about what you'd like to see in a "developer preview".

>I've given them a tidy.

Once more, thank you very much to spent time for this.

>I've just talked them through for my own clarification.

This tidy step is really a great help and the structured notes makes it
much more easier for me to visualise the goal (I'm not good in things I
cannot see/touch, like allocated memory blocks, which have to be freed).

Nevertheless some questions remains for now:

 1. While playing with the nftw() example code, I realised that I cannot
    compile it without specifying '#define _GNU_SOURCE'. Because I found
    no definition in NeoMutt's code (except for "autosetup/jimsh0.c"), I
    wonder it will be problematic on other platforms/architectures?

 2. Should we care about the help file encoding and what the user has
    set up in NeoMutt? For example, I've had set $assumed_charset to
    "iso-8859-1" for years (can't remember why), so some test help files
    won't be displayed correctly. Modifying $assume_charset or run, e.g.
    'mutt_param_set(&h->content->parameter, "charset", "unknown-8bit");'
    helps of course, but should or have we to consider this?

 3. Split up / Factor out the (filesystem) code ...
    Just to be sure, did you mean to put those code into a separate file
    like "imap/browse.c" for example?

 4. Is my thread linking OK so far? Means, one top message, one thread
    and when collapsed we'll see one index menu entry in your suggested
    10 lines for $pager_index_lines or should chapters not be linked to
    the index.md file in root?

 5. Is help directory fix, so option $help_doc_dir becomes obsolete?
    If yes, should the user be able to add his own notes, docs to the
    help system in any way?

I'll try to achieve the first of your pointed out steps the next days 
(hopefully days, not weeks). ;-)

> I cannot compile it without specifying '#define _GNU_SOURCE'

The crucial define according to the standard is: _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
    http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/

auto.def defines _GNU_SOURCE=1 for us.

Then features.h uses/defines:
_GNU_SOURCE
    _XOPEN_SOURCE=700
    _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED=1
        __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED=1
    __USE_GNU=1

This function dates back to 1995, so we should be safe.

> Should we care about the help file encoding

Hmm... Yes.  I hadn't thought of that.
The docs will be in utf-8, so they should be converted to the user's
preferred charset.

To start with, the docs will be 99.9% ascii, so we can defer this for a
while.

> put those code into a separate file like "imap/browse.c" for example?

Exactly.

Encapsulate all the filesytem code in one file.

> 4. Is my thread linking OK so far?

It's OK, but I think a simpler layout would be easier to follow.
By nesting the top-level docs, you'd make it hard to link to their children.

I'd like the layout to match the web pages.  Each directory has a
matching markdown file, that describes the section and links to all the
pages.  There's one exception, index.md, in the root.

index.md
howto.md
├─>colours.md
├─>encryption.md
└─>gmail.md
intro.md
├─>reading.md
├─>sending.md
└─>welcome.md
panel.md
├─>compose.md
├─>index.md
├─>pager.md
└─>sidebar.md

Oh, and we need to hide the web 404 page.

> 5. Is help directory fix, so option $help_doc_dir becomes obsolete?

I don't know.  What else would they look at?

That's fine (now that I know that quietness == working :-)

Ah, I see. I tricked myself by searching only in *.[ch] files with:
  $ ag --cc -C0 -- '_GNU_SOURCE'

I just thought about it related to Gentoo (compression of files in 
PKGDOCDIR, special NeoMutt ebuild overlays, probably no help documents 
at all with USE-flag "-doc" set) and a possibility to add personal 
notes. In the past and long ago, I had a special mailbox in Thunderbird 
with pseudo help messages for my flagging brain. But I think it's not an 
essential requirement.

:-)

Yes, that's mostly true and as I said previously, you can count on me 
(on things where I'm probably able to bear a helping hand).

Ah, I wondered why I saw no commits from him to the gentoo-neomutt repo 
after Nov 2016.

I think a main point is also that Mutt works for the end user and most 
people tends to be conservative, want to keep some kind of backward 
compatibility or just maintain their own private patch sets.

I understand people (to a certain extent), who want just use software 
and don't want to fight with configuration and compiling issues, because 
it eats so much time. For example, I'm happy with Vim (it provides more 
than I could ever learn) and really, I've never looked at and for a 
switch to Neovim.

But Fabian is/was the mentor of @nicolasbock (maintainer for NeoMutt at 
Gentoo). I always got quick responses from Nicolas when I filed bugs on 
Gentoo's tracker, but unfortunately nothing to my current PR about build 
breakage of the live ebuild (that will be also relevant for the new 
NeoMutt release), see <https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/8198>.

I'll contact him when he bumps Gentoo's NeoMutt ebuild to the new 
version and still miss the build issue, described in my PR. Even it 
seems I'm the only person that noticed this, its just to avoid a bad 
light on or experiences with NeoMutt.

>For every useful, often-linked, site we need to be able to say:

I'll try to keep an eye on the "up-to-date" challenge from time to time, 
because I saw some outdated parts regarded to configure/build with 
Autosetup and just to refresh my Jekyll/Ruby knowledge. Sometimes I wish 
my day has more than 24 hours, but doubt it would help. :-)

I also think it's worth to give Lua-Scripting (some of a main difference 
to Mutt) more place in the documentation and on the website to probably 
get a bigger audience of coding affine people. After writing these 
lines, I can read your thoughts. ;-)

I'll see what I can do in the future, currently Lua on Gentoo is a 
tragedy, Lua versions >= 5.1.5-r100 are still masked in portage tree 
(meanwhile Lua 5.2 is more than six years old).

Thanks for your (frame)work and your hints. I looked into it, but read

What is your goal/vision for the really nice "Improve this page"-button? 
Editing the page within a browser, is that possible with GitHub pages?

I've just updated the 'install.md' file in the source dir (and moved the
'autosetup.md' to the website.  It's written in a hurry, but much better now.

> I also think it's worth to give Lua-Scripting more place in the documentation

I've been a little cautious about this.  The Lua support is quite
limited, still, and it's unmaintained atm.  Perhaps it's time to make
Lua a "medium" task and invite someone to maintain / drive it.

> What is your goal/vision for the really nice "Improve this page"-button?

Wherever you read the help, I'd like you to be one button-press away from editing the help.

On the website, that's a link to the markdown page.  If you're logged
in, then you can hit edit and GitHub will manage the forking and stuff.

I haven't tested this personally.  Feel free to try it out on my test
repo: https://github.com/flatcap/dummy

In NeoMutt, you'd be taken to the compose menu:
    Subject: Update help page PAGE-REF
    To: help-update@neomutt.org
An editor would be opened containing the help page.  You edit, quit, and
send.

On our side, we can review and commit.
Finally, travis would build/check/deploy and the changes would be live.

It's a lot of work to get *there*, but I think all the steps forward
will help us maintain the docs and help users find stuff.
