"%a%b%c" -> menu_draw() -> make_entry()
line colour ∀ callbacks

Email(View) caches colours for row.  Array of ?
Which colours affect row?  index*
	normal, indicator handled by Menu

47 index expandos, index + 10 index_* colours
Any colour with a regex could be affected by many functions, e.g. tag

Add *tagged* colour to Menu: normal (obj), tagged, indicator
	Menu needs to know that items are tagged HOW?
	convert '*' tagged expando callback to use Menu
	tagged bitfield ∀ Menu.max
	tag notifies owner rather than owner tag() callback function
called need to get Array of tagged items!

Array of colours easier if index colours were private 0..n
they're sequential, so we could rebase them!

(1) default, (2) column, (3) cell, (4) line

0 index, 1 index_author, 2 index_collapsed, 3 index_data, 4 index_flags

which expandos need which array colours?
when are the array colours set?  lazily?
size(ARRAY) == 0 could mean zero colours
capacity of 0 => unchecked ?!o

or *static* AC *no colour
	take care clearing array!

%a needs "index" colour only
%b needs "index" + "index_subject"
%c needs "index" + 2 * "i (regex)"
