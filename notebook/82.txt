SimplePager, RegexColor

Simple coloured objects
Caller creates markup, TSArary âˆ€ Line
SimplePager can handle colour changes - wipe AC, regen/merge

If caller users RegexColor (or mix of RegexColor and SimpleColor)
then it must handle colour events
How does the SimplePager know not to do anything?
It doesn't.  It just needs to act before the caller.

RegexColor events need 3 modes: add, del, changed
*change* => regex already exists but colour has changed
SimplePager could probably handle *del* or *changed*
*del* => strip out matching TS
*changed* => clear AC
only makes sense with unified colours

SimplePager: good for *structured* text, with "objects"
???Pager : *freeform* text

Probably only ONE RegexColor for any given Dlg
User applies multiple RCs to Dlg
They all have the same CID, referencing the RegexColor
The TS (for a match) the CID isn't enough info
need the specific RC to get the AC
SimplePager cannot know how to apply colour
It must be told
