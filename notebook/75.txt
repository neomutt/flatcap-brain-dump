log msg is fixed, no odd space chars, nothing to strip
don't need a 2nd file, only need to parse once
more efficient to create TS[] ourselves?
	possibly, but complicates pager?

repain falgs: need_parse, need_wrap, need_recolor?
which config affects log msg?  any?  $history_size?  no
	if only affects the *ring* but the file is committed
wrapping config handled by pager and window events
colours: msg, warn, error (debug)
once parsed -> (cid,ac), colour event menas just recalc *ac*
log msg is line-based so won't need any TS, only default
Line {default(cid,ac), TS[], offset}
parsing log msg is trivial
parsing :set is non-trivial
but simple heuristics should be enough
command obect = (string|number|enum) -- lots of new colours
:bind, :macro similar
:version line1, bold labels, +/-feature
:help stripes + bind/macro heuristics
macro may (not) have a description, is rhs "quoted"?
variable column widths make parsing trickier
help needs to handle window events to resize cols! how?
raw file is <tab> delimited, regen file? as nec?
libpager -> libemailpager; new libpager (simple)
cache col max widths
