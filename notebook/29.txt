Expando Resizing

Fixed - text, %n.nX
Minimum - %nX
Maximum - %.nX
Padding - Soft, Hard, EOL
Container - Container, Conditional - need format syntax

N: | a,b,c,P,x,y,z |
W: | 4,5,6,?,7,3,2 |
         ^
	/ \
       {2 4}

Collect all the string to measure their lengths
=> n storages, each with colours => Nodes are R/W
	R/O => shadow set of objects
	=> work in parallel!

If we render into ONE Buffer, then truncate
	we need to understand how colours work
Individual strings (plus prefix/suffix) means we don't
we don't want  20 * 4K Buffer, even if they're reused

Calcalate

Each node / Container has (strwidth(), min, max size) screen cells
Result Buffer may have max size, e.g. screen width
∀ Node if Fixed: set min, max
if minimum, set min, calc max width with strwidth()
if maximum, set max, calc min width with strwidth()
if Container, recurse children (same for Conditional)
(1st) ∀ Node get string, Evaluate conditional
if Padding, keep track of position
	Do we need TAILQ (bidirectional)?

Phase 2 - allocate space

Node in a format string; Pad EOL must be at the end
Padding cannot be in a Conditional Node (or container)
EOL with a *space* in necessary
soft/hard at eol unnessary
built-in validators: only 1 padding
