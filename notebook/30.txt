Expando Render

Which Nodes need Buffers? (and how many)?
ExpNode needs 3 (pre, text, post)
Empty - none
Text - none, use ptrs and str*n*cpy()
Pad - char[] malloc'd & memset() - none
Condition/Container 1 Buffer for combined children? No, none
	children need to be handled individually to preserve colours
CondDate - none, calc doesn't need space
Expando - 3 * Buffer pre/post start empty - might not be used

When are Buffers allocate? Parse or Render?
many expandos won't be used => Render
Once alloc'd, leave on Node - good for freq users (index_format)


if it's not already present, factor out of expando code
