Paged File

PagerFile { fp, LA, offset, banner}
PF = new(), free(pf)
L = new_line(PF)  insert into LA
line_add_text(L, text, cid)
line_commit(L)
or
line_add_colored_text()
line_add_ansi_text()
add_ansi(L, text, ansi_start, ansi_end)
	=> TextSyntax copies strings

Doesn't allow for ANSO colours or URLS needed for :version

TS union of (cid,ac) or (start,end) + first,last flag for union
How does search work?  could overlay partial / multiple TSs
if text is [abc][d][efg] three colour blocks
and search is "cde", need to merge 3 separate times
need to split blocks 1,3?  is splitting nec?  pref not
Searching sets up the search TS[] => REPAINT

To display line, consider TS[0] (T), Search[0] (S)
T entirely before S, display T
T first, S overlaps, display T until S
order matters because we're overlaying
add_text/_search adds new TS unless same colour as previous,
when it extends the previous TS
