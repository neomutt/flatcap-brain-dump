On receipt: display
	enc key fingerprint, main key fingerprint
	real nam (email distiguish hidden from unknown (not in keyring)
	function to search & import new keys? hard
		what if there are multiple matches?
		external cmd, drop to shell?

Encrypting is *open*, keys can be read by anyone
	option for them all to be hidden?
Should outgoing mail be encrypted (encrypt-to-self)?
	of just "sent" mail
should "sent" mail folder be encrypted âˆ€ recipients?
BCC leakage
	should be hidden *at least*
	or each bcc recipient should be a separate email
		only one in "sent" mail through
	warn if we can't secure bcc anonymity

What *is* the point of encrypt-to-self?
