Color Pager

:color -> command object [attrs] fg bg [regex] # swatch

measure col widths per section
cid colours for cmd, obj, attrs, fg, bg, command
ansi for swatch. NO use relevant cid
variable number of columsn make heuristics hard (unless fixed width)

if we define lots of colours we don't need ansi in SimplePager

Is :set, etc documented?

If SimplePager text can't change, then only 1 file is nec
Use fmemopen() tmp/file, pass fp to spager
call owns LineArray, TSA; pass to spager
populate()... add_text() to file, markup to LA/TSA
∀ item : new line (set default), ∀ token new TS (cid,NULL)
text needs to be \n terminated
Use Buffer to keep track of line length, i.e. next *offset*

:set  PagedFile { fp, LA, offset}
	pf_add(pf, "set", MT_COLOR_COMMAND)
	pf_add(pf, " ", NONE), etc
