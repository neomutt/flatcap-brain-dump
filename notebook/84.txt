Search

PFile, PLineA

search/back	next/back	toggle	=> direction
search_context, text, <search><enter> => next
from start posn, how much do we search?  line, view, file?
	prob: file, it's local and fast and small

save: x matches on y lines (z concealed matches?)
<search-toggle-limit> reduces file to search matches + context
	conceal other lines
	"..." between blocks or
	underline row
	no separation if search_context=0o

$search_hidden -> search concealed text too (or $search_concealed)
ignore concealed text/Lines
until MT_COLOR_CONCEAL, need Line.hide_from_search
	for hidden headers / quoted text

Max number of wraps?  NO => 1 long line wouldn't get displayed
	test this

Use PagerLine as a ColouredLine for the Index!
eliminate the need for embedded colour codes
what about the search array?  keep it
use search to highlight matching %expando fields in Index
either entire expando, .e.g "*this field*"
or sub-expando, i.e. "this *part* of field"

"color search" exact match		} merged
"color search_line" wider context	}

e.g. search_line faint bg colour	} merged
     search      underline		}

Index: always search visible email
	search again on page-down
