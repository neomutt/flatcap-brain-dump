mute conversation

<mute-conversation> <unmute-conversation>
	or <mute-thread> <unmute-thread>
	mutes this email and below (sub-thread)
	but not necessarily the entire email thread

flat text file: DATE MESSAGE-ID
	how long is message-id?
	store a short hash instead?
	if we use a hash we'll need to write the hash
	message-id averages 50 bytes (longest 190 bytes)

on mbox_open()
	check each email against hash/array
	email->muted = true

on arrival of new mail
	check for muted
	clear new flag
	prevent notification
		how?
		need backend notification of new mail

config for cut-off date for auto-trimming?

need hash table
	or array + bsearch?

mute marks entire thread as read
