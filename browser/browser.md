# Fixing NeoMutt's Browser

## Discussions

I suggest we try, as much as possible to focus our work on browser.c/h and not
altering the code of any other file. This way, we can work in a specific branch and have a specific
architecture in the file that will merge more efficiently. Then, when we merge, we can split the content
of the file into many smaller files if that is relevant, of course.

Yes, or a separate file completely.  New file, new history.

Ah, that's a nice suggestion!

Then as it matures, we can change one user of the old browser to the improved browser.

## Goals, ideas

In a new file/directory, rebuild a clean browser application for mutt.

1. Keep all functionalities of the current mutt browser
2. Refactor all the code to get something coherent.
3. Get rid of as much ifdef as possible (being meta is the key)
4. The browser is a browser, it doesn't give any signification to its display.
     It displays and select, that's all.
5. Get coherent key bindings
6. It has features (sorting, listing, unselectable entries, tagging, â€¦)
7. mutt\_select\_file or else are browsing functions, but high-level ones,
     these functions are specific and should be defined to rely on more basic functions
     of the browser. That would reduce the redundancy in the code.

## Design Decisions

### What do we want to display?

* List of single-line items
  - Simple *Mutt*-like
  - Use format string
* List of multi-line items
  - e.g. PGP keys (may need variable number of lines):
    * Name <email>
    * Expiry, validity, etc
  - Formatting string
    * One with embedded '\n'
    * Two, second is optional
  - Colouring
    * One.  Coloured by field
    * Two, second is optional
  - Does selection highlight first line, or all lines?
    * Depends on the caller, then can mark lines selectable
  - Do we display partial multi-line rows?
* Header Row
  - Use format string to arrange header in the order of the fields
  - Highlighting of Header Row field could indicate sort field
* Separators
  - Blank - for visual clarity
  - Titled - for distinguishing groups of data
  - Inserted by the code, not the user

### How do we want to display lines?

* Flat list
  - Simple, understandable
* Nested
  - Shallow, 1 or 2 levels of nesting
  - Deep: show entire tree
    * Threaded emails
    * Nested mime attachments
* Paged
  - Display entire list
    * Caller must *have *the entire list first
    * For large mailboxes, this could be many thousands of items
  - Display subset of list
    * Caller can prepare the visible list as needed
    * Need clear visual feedback when the list is incomplete
    * How is sorting handled?

### What does the Browser know about the lines?

* Nothing
  - Browser has ordered list of items
  - Caller has formatted them
  - Caller has themed them
  - Some are selectable
* Knows about separate fields and their types
  - Browser could offer sorting

### How do we style the Browser?

Attributes: foreground colour, background colour, style, e.g. underline

* Browser
  - Panel.  Default colours for the entire panel
  - Header row (if handled by the browser)
    * Normal
    * Sort field
  - Selection
    * Current selection
    * Cursor position
    * Tagged (if handled by the browser)
* Line
  - Caller sets attributes for the entire (multi-)line
  - Caller sets attributes per line (or sub-line)
* Field
  - Caller sets attributes for an entire field
  - Caller sets attributes for part(s) of a field
* Search
  - Highlight a matching search field (even if the string isn't visible on screen)

### Folding Nested Items

* Fold levels:
  - Default fold level (like vim)
  - Open/close folds manually
  - All open by default?
  - Caller dependent
* What can we fold?
  - nested items, e.g. directories
  - multiline rows, e.g. pgp keys
* Need clear visual feedback

### Search/Limit API

If the browser doesn't know about fields, then the searching needs to be done by the caller.

* Search
  - On full fields (the on-screen fields might be truncated)
  - Search in either direction
  - Optionally wrap around
* Highlight
  - Optional
  - Highlight entire matching field (especially if the field is truncated)
  - Highlight match within a field
  - Matches:
    * No highlight, just move the cursor
    * Highlight current match
    * Highlight all matches (like vim's hlsearch)
* Limit
  - Like search
  - Optional highlighting of fields
  - Caller hides non-matching rows

**Example: **Search for 'the'

* Highlight field
  - Match visible: "weather"
  - Match not visible: "today's wea"
* Sub-field
  - Match visible: "weather"

## Glossary

* **attributes** - underline, bold, reverse, etc
* **browser** - select from a _list_ of _items_, displayed as _rows_

* **cursor** - currently selected _item_
* **entry/ies** - object representing one _item_
* **field** - piece of data belonging to an _item_
* **header** - non-selectable _row_ in the _browser_
* **hidden** - _item_ in _list_ that shouldn't be displayed
* **item** - object (in a _list_) to be selected
* **line** - one screen line, see _row_
* **list** - collection of _items_
* **panel** - window containing the _browser_
* **row** - one _item_ on screen, may use several _lines_
* **selection** - the chosen _item_
* **separator** - a non-selectable _line_ in the _list_
* **style** - _colour_ or _attributes_
* **visible** - _item_ in _list_ that shouldn't be displayed
