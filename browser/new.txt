BrowserItem needs to store raw text.
The coloured text may not be regex searchable, e.g. Wea*the*r *=colour
after event CHANGED flag on relevant items
WINCH event, send (old,new) sizes *might*not* invalidate all
it item raw data is strdup'd, then br_destroy can clean it up
mutt's sorting quirks : INBOX first, or '..' first

have area for multiline help
	current directory/folder
	valid keys for navigation
	shortcut letters / history shortcuts

use conditional for local-fs-ness
	enable drwx stuff
	one for virtual mailboxes
	one for net mailboxes

I've had an idea about customising the folder_format...  zero-width conditionals!
(this may be too complicated, but...)
the local-fs mailboxes want to have drwxr--r-- type stuff
if we created three extra expandos that don't display anything, but are bools
which could be used for conditional display %?zf?drwx stuff?
local fs %zf, virtual %zv, network %zn

browser <tab> toggle between all A and current A? (drill down)
