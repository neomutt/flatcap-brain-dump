Upgrade parsing to eliminate global MuttrcStack

It keeps track of the current file being processed
and prevents infinite loops of config files.

Create a MuttrcStack dynamically, where and when its needed.
Then pass it through all the parsing functions.

This gives the functions global-free knowledge about which file is being processed.
Stack needs to keep track of line numbers too.
The function can use buf_tell() to give the line location.
	not yet implemented

parse_ifdef() should pass the *entire* string to parse_rc_line(),
	but leave Buffer:dptr after the `ifdef`
	to allow correct line offsets

some internal commands don't have a filename
need some standard way to relay this

an internal command could `source` other files which require full path tracking
