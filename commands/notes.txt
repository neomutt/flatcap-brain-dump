command? => semi-permanent window about msgwin?
should survive window resize? but Ctrl-L should clear. HOW?
any command should clear too
Separate window allows user to read head *and* enter command
Ctrl-L -> notify of *manual* refresh
command? link to docs local file:/// or https:// ?
check if local exists?!

$neomutt_docs - file:/// or https:// base to doc tree

CLI apply to config too!

:help command/config/function
:help -> <help> ?  global -> local!

how do we auto-complete with multiple domains?
	just lump them together

add some special keywords  [patterns|formats|colors]
			 + [config|commands|functions]

config or config*s* for consistency?  allow both
:help <enter> show options

$neomutt_docs default to web.  NO local; check; fallback to web
for multiple docs, check doc root is a readable dir, not each file
start with web help only -- until $neomutt_docs
