Overlap of TextStatus

Consider T (text) and S (search)

- Neither can be empty
- They can be the same
- S is always overlaid on T, if there's an overlap

T starts: before, start of, during, end of, after S
S starts: before, start of, during, end of, after T

T ends > T: before, start of, during, end of, after S
S ends > S: before, start of, during, end of, after T

T is from:
	2-5

S is from:
	A 0-1
	B 1-2
	C 1-3
	D 1-5
	E 1-6
	F 2-3
	G 2-5
	H 2-6
	I 3-4
	J 4-5
	K 4-6
	L 5-6
