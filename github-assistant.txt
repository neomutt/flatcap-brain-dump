GitHub Assistant


Better integrate NeoMutt with GitHub Issues

Decode coded "cc:" addresses, etc
read GH "X-*:" headers

Menu:
	open issue / comment
	subsubscribe from issue (mute)
	view all issues
	mark as read (beacon) on sync-mailbox

beacon
	mshow -A text/html .github/cur/EMAIL | grep --color=never -o 'https://[^"]*beacon[^"]*'
	curl -s -o /dev/null https://github.com/notifications/beacon/XXX.gif

special treatment of
	opened, closed, re-opened issue
	add / remove label (not by email)

menu links for
	@mentions
	#NUM cross references
	search mailbox for a match

lookup @mention in aliases
	menu mailto:

How can I access the GH API from within NeoMutt?
	close issue, label issue
	=> GH module + JSON
	=> Lua + JSON

Folded issue thread, fields:
	subject
	num replies
	reactions (count)
	labels (coloured)
		or dots (coloured)
	assignees
	=> ~5/6 %L expandos

In docs for GTA, get user to enable
	notifications of own replies

Can't get label info / reactions from email

add/del label from thread (index)

get repo/issue metadata -> db (external)
	=> done by cron (daily?/hourly?)
	=> or done by neomutt manually
	e.g. label colours
	organisation member info
	might need to login

Menu:
	assign yourself to issue
	assign someone else

list reactions - per comment / per issue
abbreviate labels to first word?
abbreviate labels to coloured dot?

insert fake entries into index for
	add / del label
	assign user
	add reaction

Use GitHub Assistant as a model for:
	Debian BTS Assistant
	Trac Assistant

use GitHub API to create our own "review" marks on commits

auto update labels if a new one is encountered

option to turn :+1: into emoji character

integrate approvals (email notifications)

create fake headers
	link to post
	link for muting
	mock up using message_filter?

fake header links for mute, mark-as-read

enable functions:
	mark-as-read
	mute
	etc

manage github recipient hints
	"you were mentioned" -> flag 'M' or '@' !
	"you subscribed to" -> flag 'S' or 'âœ“' !
