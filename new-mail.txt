new mail expandos
	%n num
	one notify per folder?
	or %f! âˆ€ list
	will we ever notify on mail in multiple folders? NO
	they'll come separately
	%s! %a! (for all subjects, all authors)
	%{%a %s} for repeats?  complicated
	%n %a! %s! num, author*num, subject*num - easier
	\! for actual ! char
	different %a for name, initials, alias name, full email, encoded email, etc
	$ (sync) -> multitple new mail notifications! how to coalesce?
	freeze(), notify() * n, thaw()
	observer accumulates
	who sends freeze() -- index? YES
	with freeze/thaw should anyone send notifications with lists?
	OR send *lots* of individual notifies?
	LISTS - fewer big events, not separable

new mail hook -- frequency limit
	if time < 5s since last notification

in index->compose->index, if new mail arrives, does NewMailCmd get called in both contexts?
if NewMail is independent at dialog-level, same question.  same problem?
ah! NewMail *isn't* dialog-level, it's N-level!
probably - only 1 index gets *new mail* update, other is out-of-date!
if $nmc is global -> N-level, what if A-level? or M-level?
New mail notification happens on M, NMC (at N-level) observes,
	uses M-sub to find command at M-, A- or N-level
"easy" new-mail.c init after N, observe N, cleanup on N-close
M-, A-, N-specific expandos for #new msgs *this call* vs total #new msgs
new vs total => keep track of numbers => N, A, M-level counters?!
before each call, may need to recalc totals,
	on demand rather than continuously observing
plugin reg, config, no commands, no colours, etc -> .so?  API needed

from threads idea:
cumulative expandos for threads, etc
	%x, %Cx
	%b, %Cb

devel_new_mail_command
	for maildir only (for now)
	log command output
	not on screen unless failed
